# 5. Animation

## Pose index

A role is a kind of player with a pose of its own: an instrument with the species of its section
(`SECTION_SPECIES` of `models/cast.ts`). A species with a hold of its own is a role of its own.
The code holds the values of each hold. These product rules apply to each pose:

- **Real players.** Each role pose and its motion follow a real musician. The technique
  references give the source of each fact, and their section "Use in the app" gives the rules of
  the app and where the app differs: [strings](../reference/string-technique.md),
  [winds](../reference/wind-technique.md), [percussion](../reference/percussion-technique.md),
  [harp](../reference/harp-technique.md), and [piano](../reference/piano-technique.md).
- **Bodies stay.** The app keeps the mesh of each animal with no stretch of a limb. When a short
  arm does not reach, the app prefers a smaller instrument, a nearer place, or a hold of its own
  to longer arms.
- **Natural balance.** A standing pose, and a seated pose with no chair, keep the center of mass
  over the soles. The monkey trumpeter has no chair.
- **Grasp.** Each paw wraps its instrument as a real player does: the finger tips are on the
  instrument, the palm faces the tube or the shaft, and the paw is on the side that the
  technique names.
- **Arms close to the body.** The arms hang close to the sides, the elbows stay near the trunk,
  and the players hold their instruments close, as in the reference images. An arm can touch the
  body up to `ARM_CONTACT_DEPTH` of `pose/test-arm-clearance.ts`, and it does not have to touch.
- **Contact of the instruments.** A held instrument can press the fur where a real player touches
  it, as the contrabass on the lower belly, and it goes no further in. A rested instrument or bow
  can touch the body, and it never crosses it.

The roles and their holds:

- **Conductor:** bear, `CONDUCTOR_HOLD` (5.4).
- **Strings** (`pose/bowed-rig.ts`, strings 3): violin rabbit `SHOULDER_HOLD`, violin red fox
  `FOX_HOLD`, viola cat `CAT_HOLD`, cello dog `DOG_HOLD`, contrabass hippo `HIPPO_HOLD`.
- **Winds** (`pose/winds.ts`, winds 4): flute tan fox `FOX_FLUTE`, oboe mouse `MOUSE_OBOE`,
  clarinet wolf `WOLF_CLARINET`, bassoon beaver `BEAVER_BASSOON`, horn pig `PIG_HORN`, trumpet
  monkey `MONKEY_TRUMPET`, trombone panda `PANDA_TROMBONE`, tuba rhino `RHINO_TUBA`.
- **Percussion** (`pose/percussion-rig.ts`, percussion 10): timpani elephant, and the badger with
  the bass drum, the snare drum, the suspended cymbal, the small percussion, and the xylophone
  (`PERCUSSION_HOLDS`, `SUSPENDED_CYMBAL_HOLD`).
- **Piano and harp** (`pose/hands.ts`, `HANDS_HOLDS`): piano polar bear (piano), harp deer
  (harp 6).
- **Choir:** penguin, `CHOIR_HOLD` (5.3).

`INSTRUMENT_SUPPORTS` and `supportOf()` of `models/player.ts` give the supports (4.5). The
pianist sits on a bench, and the harpist on a stool. The conductor, the contrabass, the trumpet,
the tuba (as on a strap), the percussion, and the choir stand. The oboe and the bassoon have no
chair and sit in the seated pose at the seat height of their legs. The others sit on a chair. The
violins, the viola, the flute, the oboe, the clarinet, the horn, and the trombone stand as a
soloist, a player alone, or the partner of a pianist (4.2). The generic holds
`BOWED_HOLDS.violin`, `BOWED_HOLDS.cello`, `WIND_HOLDS.flute`, and `WIND_HOLDS.trombone` are for a
new species of these sections. `pnpm close-views <role> <dir>` renders a role with the views of
`ROLE_VIEWS` (7.1). Each new role or hold adds its entry here.

## 5.1 Pose function

The pose of each animal is a **pure function**. `poseAt()` calculates each pose only from the
score, the scene layout, the song time, the wall time, the transport, the audibility of the seats,
and the seed. The app keeps no state that events change. Thus seek, pause, speed, mute, and solo
changes are always correct, and the animation cannot drift from the audio.

```typescript
/** The play state. It changes only on play, pause, and stop. */
interface Transport {
  playing: boolean;
  /** Wall clock seconds of the last change. `null` before the first play. */
  changedAtWall: number | null;
  /** The transport before the last change, or `null` for the rest pose (5.2). */
  before: Transport | null;
  /** The song time of the first sound of the last play: 0, or the pause point (6.5). */
  startSec: number;
  /** The time that the instruments stay up after a pause (`REST_TIMES.hold`), or 0. */
  holdSec: number;
  /** The wall clock seconds from a play to its first sound. */
  leadSec: number;
}

/** The mute and solo result of one seat (6.6). */
interface SeatAudibility {
  audible: boolean;
  changedAtWall: number;
  before: SeatAudibility | null;
}

/** The pose of one animal for one frame. Optional fields add the paw turns and the keys. */
interface AnimalPose {
  /** One quaternion (x, y, z, w) for each bone, in the order of `BONE_NAMES` (4.7). */
  rotations: Float32Array;
  rootOffset: Vec3;
  /** The move of the `slide` bone: the trombone slide and the damper pedal (4.6). */
  slideOffset: Vec3;
  /** The move of the `instrument` bone, such as the violin at rest (5.2). */
  instrumentOffset?: Vec3;
  /** 0 is open eyes, 1 is closed eyes. */
  blink: number;
}

interface ScenePose {
  /** One entry for each player, in the order of `SceneLayout.players`. */
  players: AnimalPose[];
  /** `null` for a chamber group, which has no conductor (4.2). */
  conductor: AnimalPose | null;
}

/** The data of one `Score` that each frame needs. */
interface PosePlan {
  players: readonly PlayerPlan[];
  conductor: PlayerPlan | null;
  /** The player that leads a chamber group, or `null` with a conductor (5.4). */
  leader: number | null;
  /** The conducted beats and the beats of the felt pulse, in song seconds. */
  beats: Float64Array;
  pulses: Float64Array;
  /** The song end. The conductor bows after it (5.4). */
  endSec: number;
}

/** The places of the scene for one `Score` (4.5). */
interface SceneLayout {
  stageSide: number;
  podium: Vec3;
  /** The bear on the podium top, or `null` for a chamber group. */
  conductor: { position: Vec3; facing: number } | null;
  /** `facing` is radians around y, and 0 faces -z (the back). */
  players: readonly { position: Vec3; facing: number; cast: PlayerCast }[];
  stands: readonly StandPlace[];
  risers: readonly RiserLevel[];
}

declare function layoutScene(score: Score, models?: ModelCache): SceneLayout;
declare function preparePoses(score: Score, layout: SceneLayout, seed: number): PosePlan;
declare function poseAt(
  plan: PosePlan,
  songTime: number,
  wallTime: number,
  transport: Transport,
  /** One entry for each seat. A missing entry sounds. */
  audibility: readonly (SeatAudibility | undefined)[],
  out?: ScenePoseBuffer,
): ScenePose;
```

The app calls `layoutScene()` and `preparePoses()` one time for each `Score`. Each frame then only
looks up the song time in sorted lists and writes into one buffer, so 60 players fit in the frame
budget (9.7). `poseAt()` also solves the IK of 4.7. The app poses each demo with the seed 1, so a
demo shows the same motion on each visit.

| Layer | Clock | Motion |
|---|---|---|
| Note | song time | Bow strokes, fingers, breath, mallets, hands (5.3) |
| Beat | song time | A sway with the felt pulse, and the conductor (5.4) |
| Idle | wall clock time | Breath, eye blinks, ears, tail, looks at the conductor |

- **Motion families.** Each instrument has a family with its own note layer: `bowed`,
  `woodwind`, `brass`, `keyboard`, `harp`, `percussion`, `choir`, or `conductor`.
- **Beat layer.** In a passage, a player sways from side to side with the felt pulse
  (`beatSway()`). A real player sways with a slow level of the meter, so the pulse is the
  conducted beat (5.4) up to `PULSE_TEMPO`, the preferred tempo of a listener, and 2 or 4
  conducted beats above it (`markPulses()`).
- **Idle layer.** The idle layer uses the wall clock, so the animals stay alive while the music
  stops. Its motions come at seeded times in windows of the wall clock, so they need no state
  (`IDLE_MOTION`). Hanging ears do not twitch, as a real hanging ear does not
  (`SpeciesParams.hangingEars`).

## 5.2 Rest pose

Before the first play, the players are in the rest pose, because a real orchestra lifts the
instruments only when the conductor signals the start. The players lift their instruments in the
count-in (5.4, 6.5), and lower them when the hold of `transport.holdSec` after a pause ends.

- **Natural motion.** Each player has its own seeded lift and lowering (`restMotion()`,
  `REST_MOTION` of `pose/rest.ts`). The principal of a seat moves first, and the others follow in
  a ripple, as real players watch their leader. The winds lift sooner, because they also breathe
  before the first note. The conductor gives the count-in, so its motion does not vary.

  ```typescript
  /** The timing of one move of the instruments: a lift or a lowering. */
  interface RestMove {
    delaySec: number; // wall clock seconds
    durationSec: number;
    skew: number; // the seeded skew of the curve, near 1
  }

  /** The seeded lift and lowering of one animal (`PlayerPlan.motion`). */
  interface RestMotion {
    lift: RestMove;
    lower: RestMove;
    fitSec: number; // the longest lift of the group, with its delay
  }
  ```

- **No jump.** A move starts from the height of each player at the change, from
  `transport.before` (`changeTransport()` of `app/transport.ts`).
- **Count-in.** The slowest lift ends before the downbeat. A shorter count-in scales all lifts by
  one factor (`liftScale()`). A pause in the count-in lowers the instruments at once.
- **No wrist flip.** A paw does not turn past 180° on its forearm in a move, because the twist
  bone (`TWIST_SHARE` of `models/studio-rig.ts`) then turns over in one frame. The arm gate checks
  each move (`probeMoves()` of `tools/arm-check.ts`).
- **Seated posture.** Each seated player sits tall off the chair back, with the hips above the
  knees, vertical shins, and the soles flat, as real seated string players sit: "The main point
  is that your hips are higher than your knees" (violinist.com, discussion 9372). The seat stays
  level, and its height fits the legs (`seatHeights()` of `models/props.ts`, 4.4). The polar bear
  sits on the front half of a low bench, as a pianist does (piano 2).
- **Hanging arms.** A standing player with free hands hangs its arms (`HANG` of `pose/hang.ts`),
  with the palms at the height of the hips.

The rest of each family:

- **Violin and viola.** A seated player rests as a seated violinist (strings 2.9): the instrument
  upright on the left thigh, the neck through the closed left paw, and the bow upright at the
  right side (`restHandAt()`, `UPRIGHT_BOW`). In a move, the instrument turns with the left paw as
  one rigid object (`carryLift()`), and the bow tip turns through the front (`BowVia`). A
  standing player hangs the bow with the tip down (`HANGING_BOW`).
- **Cello and contrabass.** The instrument stays at its playing place. The dog holds the bow over
  the right knee with the tip up, as a cellist does. The hippo hangs the bow beside the belly,
  because its short knee is under the belly.
- **Winds.** The head lifts, and the instrument moves off the mouth. Both paws keep their grips
  (`restAim`), so no paw slides along the tube. A real player can rest the instrument on a leg,
  but the round bellies of the mouse, the wolf, the beaver, and the pig cover their thighs. So
  these instruments stay in front of the belly.
- **Piano and harp.** The polar bear sits tall with a small lean to the piano and the head up, as
  a pianist before a performance, with the paws in front of the lower belly (`restLean`). The
  deer sits up with each hand near a string.
- **Percussion.** A ready player keeps its mallets over the instrument (`PercussionHold.ready`),
  because a lift from hanging arms sweeps them through the body or the kettles. The snare sticks
  rest level across the waist, as a snare drummer between entries (`PercussionHold.set`).
- **Choir.** The penguin keeps the folder in front of the chest, as a choir between two pieces.

## 5.3 Instrument motion

- **Timing.** The motion of a note starts before the note and ends at the note start, because the
  app reads the full file first. Each player has a small seeded offset in timing and amplitude
  (`PLAYER_OFFSETS`), so that players in unison do not move as copies.
- **Loudness.** The size of a gesture comes from the velocity, CC 7, and CC 11 at the note start
  (`pose/loudness.ts`), from `Score.synthEvents`, so the sound and the gestures use the same
  events.
- **Chords.** Notes of a player that start within `CHORD_SEC` form one stroke, strike, or chord
  (3.8).
- Version 1 has no extra effects, for example no music-note particles.

**Bowed strings** (`pose/fingering.ts`, `pose/strokes.ts`, `pose/bowed.ts`, strings 3):

- A search (Viterbi) gives each stroke its string, position, and finger before the play
  (`planHand()`, `FINGERING_COSTS`), in the orchestral style: low positions and open strings. The
  hand shifts only when the notes leave its position. Vibrato keeps the width of a real player.
- The bow changes direction on each note, and short notes in one beat join into one slur
  (`slurSizes()`), because the MIDI files have no slurs. Pizzicato plucks the string, and tremolo
  makes short fast strokes (`BOW_MOTION`).
- The arms are a little short for the instruments. So the right shoulder turns forward and the
  stick leans, so that the bow reaches the full hair (`bowRangeOf()`).

**Woodwinds and brass** (`pose/wind-notes.ts`, `pose/winds.ts`, winds 4):

- A wind player shows one note, and breathes in before a phrase. The mouthpiece stays at the
  mouth, so the look at the conductor does not turn the head.
- Each paw closes around its tube (`WindHold.faceTube`, `gripShiftL`). `pnpm wind-grip` measures
  the grasp in each phase.
- A brass player presses the valves of the pitch (`BRASS_FUNDAMENTALS`), and the partials skip
  the flat seventh partial, as real players do (`PARTIALS`).
- The trombone slide takes the position of the pitch, mapped into the travel that the arm
  reaches (`slideTravel()`). The arms do not grow for the slide.

**Percussion** (`pose/strikes.ts`, `pose/percussion.ts`, percussion 10):

- Each paw holds its mallet in the closed fingers, with the head out of the front of the fist,
  and keeps one roll on the shaft through the stroke (`MalletSpot`, `gripRoll()`).
- A mallet lifts before a strike, comes down at full speed at the note start, and rebounds
  (`STRIKE_MOTION`). A chord takes both hands, a fast repeat takes the other hand, and a hand
  does not cross the other.
- The paws of the elephant rest above the near rims, as in the reference images, so its mallets
  strike further in than a real timpanist (`PercussionHold.rim`). The short arms of the badger
  cannot hold hand cymbals out of the round body, so it plays a suspended cymbal
  (`SpeciesParams.cymbalForm`). The xylophone bars are smaller than real bars, so the short arms
  reach each one.

**Piano** (`pose/hands.ts`, `pose/piano-keys.ts`, piano):

- The left hand plays low notes and the right hand high notes. A narrow chord goes to the nearer
  hand, so a melody stays in one hand (`HANDS_HOLDS`, `splitHands()`).
- The wide paws keep apart (`apart`). When the two parts of a wide chord, such as a bass and a
  melody, come nearer, each paw plays a few keys away from its part (`HandNote.shift`). Thus the
  two parts stay in two paws, and one paw does not jump between them.
- Each key goes down with its notes, from the note start to the note end (`keyLevelsAt()`), so a
  seek and a mute give the correct keys at once.
- The paw moves in for a black key, so the claws lie on it, as a pianist moves the hand in toward
  the fallboard (piano 5, `pianoKeyFront()`).
- The piano is larger than a real grand piano (`PIANO_SCALE`), because the bear is large. The keys
  stand near the bear (`PIANO_FRONT_H`), because farther keys pull the haunch into the bench, and
  nearer keys fold the shoulders.
- The trunk leans toward the keys of the paws over a window of song time (`sideLeanAt()`), so it
  moves smoothly toward the register of a passage, as a real pianist.
- The right foot presses the damper pedal with the sustain pedal of the score (CC 64,
  `pedalLevelAt()`), and the synth reads the same events.

**Harp** (harp 6): the palm faces the string of its note and pulls away to pluck.

**Choir** (`pose/choir.ts`): the `jaw` bone opens the beak for each note and closes it to half
between two notes, so that each note shows (`CHOIR_MOTION`). Neighbor voices sway to opposite
sides, so that the choir does not move as one block.

## 5.4 Conductor

The bear beats real beat patterns from the time signatures and the tempo map. A conductor beats a
fast bar in fewer beats, so the baton beats no faster than `ONE_BEAT_TEMPO` of `score/beats.ts`.

| Time signature | Pattern (`barPattern()`) |
|---|---|
| 2/x, 3/x | 1 from `ONE_BEAT_TEMPO`, else 2 or 3 |
| 4/x | 1 from twice `ONE_BEAT_TEMPO`, 2 from `ONE_BEAT_TEMPO`, else 4 |
| 6/8, 6/4 | 2 from `TWO_BEAT_TEMPO`, else 6 |
| 9/8, 12/8 | 1 or 2 from `ONE_BEAT_TEMPO` in dotted beats, else 3 or 4 |
| others, such as 5/4 | `generic`: one down-up motion for each beat unit |

- At each beat, the baton tip is at the point of the beat (`BEAT_PATTERNS`). Between two beats,
  the tip rises in an arc and comes down at full speed. The size follows the loudness.
- **Count-in.** A click on play does not start the music at once: the conductor first signals the
  players to get ready. The transport starts before the start point (6.5), so the count-in is a
  set of poses at those song times (`COUNT_IN`): a ready pause, then one preparatory beat.
- **Baton.** The bear holds one baton, in the right paw, with the palm down (`CONDUCTOR_HOLD`).
- **Bow.** At the song end, the bear bows to the orchestra (`END_BOW`).
- **Chamber group.** A chamber group has no conductor, so its leader gives the count-in with a
  breath and a nod, as in a string quartet (`leaderOf()`, `LEADER_NOD`).
- **Cues.** The conductor cues each section entry, as a real conductor does (`findCues()`,
  `cueStateAt()`). A strong entry gets the baton, and each other entry the left hand. A cue to
  silent seats does not show (5.5).

  ```text
  time (s)    -1.1        -0.5      0           0.6         1.2
  head, body  |--- turn --|--- on the section --|--- back --|
  left hand     |-- rise -|-- down -|-hold|--- down --|
  baton       the beat pattern goes on in a beat plane that turns half as far as the upper body
  ```

  ```typescript
  /** One cue of the conductor (`pose/cues.ts`). */
  interface Cue {
    entrySec: number; // the first note of the cued entry
    landSec: number; // the entry, or the downbeat of the count-in
    beatSec: number;
    kind: 'hand' | 'baton';
    seats: readonly number[];
    torsoYaw: number;
    headYaw: number;
    headPitch: number;
    handYaw: number;
    batonLift: number; // the extra height of the arc of the baton, in meters
  }
  ```

- **Left hand between the cues** (`pose/conductor-left.ts`). A real conductor uses the left hand
  for the dynamics, for held notes, and for a mirror of the beat (`LEFT_HAND_PLACES`). The places
  stand at the left of the head, so the hand shows from behind.

  ```text
  quiet place --mirror--> --swell--> --fade--> --hold--> --cue or ready--> wrist and fingers
   (always)    (level)    (trend>0)  (trend<0)  (chord)    (5.4 cues)
  each arrow mixes the next place in by its weight, from 0 to 1. A later place wins.
  the playing pose (5.2) then mixes the hanging arm into the result.
  ```

  ```typescript
  /** The data of the left hand that the pose looks up at each frame. */
  interface LeftHandTrack {
    /** The conducted beats, and the weight of each place at each beat, from 0 to 1. */
    beats: Float64Array;
    mirror: Float32Array;
    swell: Float32Array;
    fade: Float32Array;
    /** The held chords, sorted by start, and their starts for the search. */
    holds: readonly Hold[];
    holdStarts: Float64Array;
  }

  /** A held chord: a time with sound and with no new note. */
  interface Hold {
    startSec: number;
    endSec: number;
    /** The sound stops before the next notes, so the fingers close to cut it off. */
    cutOff: boolean;
  }
  ```

## 5.5 Silent seats

A muted seat, or a seat that a solo makes silent, rests: its instruments go down, and only the
idle motion continues. Thus what the user sees agrees with what the user hears. Each player
lowers and lifts with its seeded motion (5.2), with no hold and no scale. A change starts from
the height of each player at the change, from `SeatAudibility.before`
(`changeAudibility()` of `app/transport.ts`).

## 5.6 Camera shots

The automatic camera of 2.5 films the piece as a concert film does. `cameraAt()` calculates the
camera only from the shot plan, the song time, the transport, and the view. `prepareShots()` makes
the plan one time for each score. Thus a seek, a pause, and a speed change are always correct, and
the same piece gives the same film. `pnpm shot-trace` prints the choice at each cut.

```text
 score ──> layoutScene() ──> layout ──┬──> preparePoses() ──> PosePlan ──> poseAt() ───┐
   │                                  │                                                │

                                         StageScene.pose() and StageScene.follow(camera)
```

```typescript
type ShotKind = 'wide' | 'high' | 'conductor' | 'side' | 'section' | 'solo';

interface ShotKey {
  azimuth: number;   // radians around y, from +z (the audience) to +x
  elevation: number; // radians above the stage plane
  zoom: number;      // a factor of the fit distance, or of the wide distance
  fov: number;       // the vertical field of view, in degrees
}

interface Shot {
  kind: ShotKind;
  startSec: number;    // the first shot starts at -Infinity
  endSec: number;      // the last shot ends at Infinity
  moveEndSec: number;
  seats: readonly number[];
  part: readonly number[] | null; // the players of a choir part, such as the sopranos
  target: Vec3;
  radius: number;      // the subject sphere, or 0 for a wide or a high shot
  from: ShotKey;
  to: ShotKey;
  blendSec: number;    // 0 is a hard cut
}
```

Each camera stands on a sphere around its target at the fit distance of the subject for the
current aspect, so a phone in portrait gets a camera farther away.

| Kind | Camera |
|---|---|
| wide | the default view of 4.5, or a variant (`WIDE_VARIANTS`) |
| high | high, near the front |
| conductor | behind the bear: close, or over the shoulder at the players |
| side, section, solo | low, from the front of one side, one group, or one player |

- The shots follow the views of `scene.png`. The conductor shows only from behind, as in the
  reference images (1). All shots keep the camera a little low, as the default view does.
- Each move blends its keys with a smoothstep over the full shot and turns around the target, so
  it starts and ends at rest and never cuts through the subject.

**Cuts and choice.** A cut falls on a downbeat or on the middle beat of a bar, with a bonus for a
phrase line (`CUT_BONUS`). The camera films the player who just started to play: a cut at an
entry gets the largest bonus. The first shot is the default view, as the establishing shot of a
concert film, and the last shot pulls out. The planner reads the music after the cut
(`MUSIC_RULES`): the share of each group, the entries, a tutti, and the lead, because a concert
film follows the melody. Then these rules apply, in this order (`CHOICE_WEIGHTS`, `SHOT_TIMES`):

1. No repeat of the kind and the subject of the previous shot.
2. No section or solo shot of the group of the previous shot.
3. Spacing: a wide, high, conductor, or side shot waits some shots since the last one.
4. Variety: a subject that the film showed lately loses score.
5. Seeded jitter.
6. The best candidate with a clear camera wins. Else the previous shot holds.

A score with fewer than `SMALL_GROUP_SEATS` seats gets no conductor shot, because the back of the
bear gives weak frames of a solo. Mute and solo do not change the plan.

**Clearance.** The camera never stands inside a player, and the subject does not hide. The
planner tests each move and sight line against the boxes of `layoutObstacles()`, at the aspects
1.6 and 0.46, because one plan serves all views. The frame tests (`shots/test-shot-frames.ts`)
copy these numbers of the design:

- The line of sight from 0.3 m outside the target crosses no box, except the boxes within 0.4 m of
  the target.
- No head in the foreground of a close shot has a radius above 0.24 of half the frame height.
- No other object nearer than 0.9 of the focus depth covers more than 15% of a 20 × 20 grid.
- Each camera keeps 0.6 m from each box, 1.0 m from the podium and the conductor, and 0.6 m above
  the stage top.
- A camera stays on one side of the beam cone for a full shot, because a crossing darkens the
  image at once.

**Transitions, beam, and light.** A hard cut is the default. A blend is a short camera move in a
slow or quiet window (`BLEND_RULES`), because a true dissolve needs two renders for each frame.
The beam fades in the close shots, because a close camera sees the additive beam over the full
image. A close shot gets its own soft key, a kicker, and a stronger vignette, as a film crew
lights each setup again (`SHOT_LIGHT`). The weights come from the kind of the shot, so they do not
change in a shot.

```typescript
const SHOT_BEAM_OPACITY = {
  wide: 1,
  high: 1,
  conductor: CLOSE_BEAM_OPACITY,
  side: CLOSE_BEAM_OPACITY,
  section: CLOSE_BEAM_OPACITY,
  solo: CLOSE_BEAM_OPACITY,
} as const satisfies Record<ShotKind, number>;
```

During play, `cameraAt()` uses `t = max(songTime, transport.startSec)`, so the count-in holds the
camera of the start point.
