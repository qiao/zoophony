# Rigging

This module of `AGENTS.md` gives the bodies of the app, the asset chain, the arm gate, the rebuild
of the arms in Blender, the traps of the rig, and the brief of a rigging round. Design 4.4 gives
the rules of the bodies. The reference images are the target of each body.

## Bodies and roles

Each species has a studio body (`body: 'studio-<a>'`). The roles are the names that
`pnpm fold-probe`, `pnpm hold-fit`, `pnpm arm-check`, and `pnpm close-views` take.
`pnpm pose-depth violinist` sweeps the rabbit and the red fox together. "Rebuilt arms" means quad
arm tubes, Blender weights, and arm segments (see "The rebuild of the arms in Blender").

| Species | Body | Role |
|---|---|---|
| bear | T-pose mesh, rebuilt arms (`bear_arms.py`), wrist skin normals (`rootNormals.wrist`), a larger crease angle and a color blend. Stands on the podium, with the baton along the index finger. | `conductor` |
| polar-bear | T-pose mesh, rebuilt arms and legs (`polar_bear_arms.py`, `polar_bear_legs.py`), dual quaternion knees (`bind.knee`, `kneeCrease`), the old bone heat (`heatSource`), and the leg length of the mesh. Sits on a bench that fits its haunch (`benchFitOf()`) at a piano of `PIANO_SCALE`, with the right foot on the damper pedal. | `pianist` |
| rabbit | A-pose mesh, longer rebuilt arms (`violin_arms.py`), a supinated bind left paw (`bindSupination`), root and elbow skin normals, a smaller violin. | `violinist` |
| fox-red | Longer rebuilt arms (`fox_arms.py`), a supinated bind left paw, a `raise` shape that smooths the bow arm at rest, a tail of two bones. | `fox-violinist` |
| fox-tan | The red fox rig with a tan palette (`palettes`). | `flutist` |
| cat | Rebuilt arms with a round side wall and a clean armpit line (`cat_arms.py`), a dual quaternion left lower arm (`bind.arm`), three `raise` shapes with `follow` at the left arm root, a viola of `violaScale`. | `violist` |
| dog | A copy with round inner arms (`dog-arms.glb`), a cut at each arm seam, a chest share of the inner arm root (`weights.armRoot`), a round hanging tail. | `cellist` |
| panda | The mesh with the rule weights. | `trombonist` |
| hippo | Longer rebuilt arms with a seam cut and a side wall (`hippo_arms.py`), smoothed arm tubes (`armSmooth`), smaller pea eyes. Stands at the contrabass. | `bassist` |
| mouse | Longer rebuilt arms (`wind_arms.py`), a long tail on the floor, a smaller oboe, no chair (`noChair`). | `oboist` |
| elephant | A-pose mesh, rebuilt arms with flatter inner upper arms (`elephant_arms.py`). Stands at the timpani, with the trunk on the head. | `timpanist` |
| beaver | Root skin normals, a broad tail on the floor, a smaller bassoon, no chair. | `bassoonist` |
| pig | A copy with round upper arms free of the trunk (`pig-arms.glb`), a twist bone of each upper arm (`upperTwist`), a horn turned back toward the body. | `hornist` |
| wolf | Longer rebuilt arms (`wind_arms.py`), lower and wider than the mesh (`proportions`), a bind elbow bent forward and supinated bind paws (`bindArms`), the clarinet bell against the right knee at rest. | `clarinetist` |
| badger | A tail ball and a suspended cymbal (`cymbalForm`). Stands at each percussion instrument. | `bass-drummer`, `snare-drummer`, `cymbalist`, `percussionist`, `xylophonist` |
| monkey | Longer arms, a long tail curled on the floor, a smaller trumpet, no chair. Stands with its feet under its hips and its trunk leaned forward. | `trumpeter` |
| rhino | T-pose mesh, rebuilt arms (`rhino_tpose_arms.py`), a bind elbow bent forward, a tail ball. Stands at a tuba with a longer lead pipe (`tubaPipe`). | `tubist` |
| deer | Longer rebuilt arms with a side wall (`deer_arms.py`), a bind upper arm near the hanging arm (`bindArms`), antlers on the head. Sits on the harp stool, with a smaller harp (`harpScale`) on its right shoulder. | `harpist` |
| penguin | The flippers as arms, a split beak with a jaw bone (`penguin-beak.glb`), faces cut along the black and white edge (`penguin-edge.glb`), a larger crease angle and a color blend. Stands on its riser with the folder. | `singer` |

The penguin has no sheet, so `pnpm choir-check <dir>` compares it with the choir of the two newest
reference images.

## The asset chain

Each body comes from a textured mesh with no skeleton. The tools rig it into the GLB format of the
studio, then pack it into a module that the app reads.

```text
 assets/models/<s>/<s>.glb (source mesh, unchanged)
   | tools/blender/<a>_arms.py (only a body with rebuilt arms or legs)
   v
 <s>-arms.glb + <s>-weights.json (a copy with quad tubes and Blender weights)
   | pnpm rig-mesh <a>   (tools/mesh-rigs/<a>.json, Blender)
   v
 <s>.rig.glb (face colors, gloss, chair, joints, shapes, clip `reference`)
   | pnpm studio-body <a> (ANIMALS of tools/studio-body.ts, no Blender)
   v
 src/models/studio/<a>.ts --> STUDIO_BODIES --> SPECIES[<s>].body
```

The app keeps its own motion: `poseStudioBones()` of `src/models/studio-rig.ts` drives the studio
bones from the pose of the player on each frame. `lowpoly-studio/` can also build a rigged GLB file
from a reference sheet. It is a separate project outside the rules of `AGENTS.md`.

### Steps of a new body

1. **Joints.** Measure the joints on cuts of the mesh, and write them in
   `tools/mesh-rigs/<a>.json` with a note on each measure. Start with the arm factor 1 and the leg
   factor 1. The first line of `pnpm rig-mesh <a> --check` gives the arm factor of the target
   reach.
2. **Form.** A body that is shorter or wider than the mesh takes `proportions`. A head that keeps
   its form takes `"keep": "head"` with a blend zone on the neck above the shoulder tops. A larger
   head grows `H`, so fit the holds again.
3. **Options.** Run `pnpm mesh-options <a> <dir> --size <label>=<head top>... --arms <f>,...
   --legs <f>,... --instrument <id>`. Fix each warning of the rigs, then ask the user about the
   size, the arms, and the legs with `options.md` and `options.png`.
4. **Rig.** Look at the seated bind, the standing body, the knees, and the bones with
   `pnpm rig-mesh <a> --check --preview <dir>`. Try each variant with `--check --set`. The
   triangles and the gzip size stay in their budgets, and the standing body stays within 1 mm of
   the source.
5. **Export.** Add the animal to `ANIMALS` with the landmark of its scale (the shoulder joints, or
   the keys of a pianist), a crease angle that matches the facet contrast of its reference crops,
   and the seat settings. Run `pnpm studio-body <a>`, add the module to `STUDIO_BODIES`, and give
   the species the body.
6. **Holds.** Fit the holds in the `H` of the new body with `pnpm hold-fit <role> --set`,
   `pnpm hold-reach <species>`, and `pnpm pose-depth <role>`. Run `pnpm body-probe --base <start>`
   after a change of shared code: the other players do not change.

A new role adds in the same commit its entries in `SWEEP_ROLES` of `src/pose/test-sweep-roles.ts`,
`FOLD_ROLES` of `tools/fold-probe.ts`, and `ROLE_VIEWS` of `tools/close-views.ts`, and its rows in
the table above and in the pose index of design 5. Only the last commit of a series of rig commits
writes the GLB file, together with its module.

## The arm gate

A fold count does not see a twisted or a flat arm. Each round that changes a hold, a rig, a pose,
an instrument size, or a seat runs `pnpm arm-check <roles> --base <start> --views <dir>`, and puts
the table and the crop pairs into its report. A `FAIL` makes the round not done. A better number
with a worse look is also not done.

- `--trace <demo>:<from>-<to>` finds a fast turn of a paw. `--states <ref>,...` compares old
  commits.
- `tools/merge-branch.sh` runs the gate of all roles for a change of `src/pose/`, `src/models/`,
  or `tools/blender/`.
- The grip turn compares each paw with `ACCEPTED_GRIPS` of `tools/arm-check.ts`. A new role adds
  its entry. Change an entry only after the manager accepts the 2x paw crops at a strike and at
  rest.
- `pnpm arm-look <role>` measures a crumpled or a flat upper arm. Read the 2x crops from the front,
  the back, and each side, because a defect can show from one side only.

## The rebuild of the arms in Blender

Rebuild the arms when they show a spiral crease, a sharp elbow, slivers, or slits. Rebuild the legs
when the seated legs show a wedge. Three causes add up, so fix all three:

- **Faces.** Long thin triangles across a joint fold into a spiral. New quad faces fix it.
- **Bones.** The linear blend collapses the skin under a large twist on one bone. Short segments
  keep each step below about 25°.
- **Hold.** The hold sets the total twist. A real forearm turns about 90°. When a hold asks for
  160° or more, change the hold or the instrument first.

### Rules

- Work in the live Blender through Blender MCP with the plain Blender tools. Look at an image after
  each step. Write no weight algorithm of your own.
- Change only the limb faces from the shoulder line to the wrist, or from the haunch line to the
  ankle. The new surface lies on the old limb. Ask the user before the first rebuild of a species.
- Keep the source file. Write the copy next to it, with a note in the `README.md` of the folder.
- Never call `read_factory_settings`, because it stops the MCP server. Stop only the Blender
  process that you start.

### Steps

1. Import the source, and run Merge by Distance, because automatic weights fail on split seams.
2. Bisect each arm at the shoulder line and at the wrist, and delete the faces between the cuts.
3. Build a quad tube of 15 rings of 16 vertices: 5 on the upper arm, 3 at the elbow, 8 on the
   forearm, and 2 at the wrist. Each ring stands at a right angle to its bone.
4. Shrinkwrap the tube onto a hidden copy of the old arm, and join it to the trunk and the paw with
   Bridge Edge Loops.
5. Bake the fur color of the old arm onto a UV strip of the atlas, and transfer the custom normals
   of the old surface.
6. Add the studio skeleton with the segments and the helpers, and parent with Automatic Weights.
   Run Limit Total 4 and Normalize All.
7. Fix the weights with Weight Paint: remove the arm bones from the trunk below the armpits, and
   smooth the shoulder line. Look at the arm down, forward, an elbow at 100°, and a forearm turn
   of 90°.
8. Write the weights file and the replay script `tools/blender/<a>_arms.py`. A headless run gives
   the same bytes.

For the legs (`polar_bear_legs.py`), cut below the crotch and above the foot, build the tube before
the leg factor, keep the rule weights with a knee ramp (`paintedLower`, `weights.knee`), and give
the kept vertices the old bone heat (`heatSource`).

### Bones

Each upper arm and each forearm has 4 deform segments, and each elbow and each wrist has a helper
bone. The old arm bones hold no skin and only drive the new bones. `armSegments` of the config
turns this on.

```text
 clavicle --> upper_arm (drives) --+-- upper_arm_seg0..3 (roll 1/8 .. 7/8)
                                   +-- elbow helper (half of upper -> fore)
              forearm (drives) ----+-- forearm_seg0..3 (twist 1/8 .. 7/8)
              forearm_twist -------+-- wrist helper (half of fore+twist -> paw)
              hand (skin) --> fingers (skin)
```

```typescript
/** The arm segments and the helpers of one arm, as indices in `STUDIO_BONES`. */
interface StudioArmSegments {
  /** Segment k takes (k + 0.5) / 4 of the roll of the upper arm from the chest. */
  readonly upper: readonly number[];
  /** Segment k takes (k + 0.5) / 4 of the twist from the forearm to the paw. */
  readonly fore: readonly number[];
  /** Turns halfway from the upper arm to the forearm, around the elbow. */
  readonly elbow: number;
  /** Turns halfway from the forearm with all of the twist to the paw, around the wrist. */
  readonly wrist: number;
}
```

`poseSegments()` of `src/models/studio-rig.ts` and `driven_turns()` of
`tools/blender/rig_mesh.py` turn the new bones with the same rule. `paintedWeights` names the
weights file, and `paintedLower` lists the bones that keep the rule weights. Each body with
`armSegments` has 20 more bone matrices, so run `pnpm frame` after a new one.

## Traps

Read the group of your work before you plan it.

### Paws and twist

- The retarget turns each paw toward its forearm in the plane of the palm (`PAW_TURN`), up to 70°.
  A pose can give a paw its own turn (`pawTurnL`, `pawKeepR`).
- The bind paw of a mesh is pronated, so a far supinated hold passes 180° of skin twist. Supinate
  the bind paw by about half of the play twist (`studio.bindSupination`).
- `twistAngle()` flips when the paw turn passes 180°. Lower the twist of the hold, or move its zero
  with the bind paw. Carry no value from the last frame.
- A turn of the bind forearm about the upper arm (`studio.bindArms`) moves the zero of the paw twist
  and of the upper arm roll.
- The `palm` of a rig config sets the roll of the arm bones. Read it from the curl of the claws.
- A paw that turns about 160° on its forearm folds the wrist. Hold the part near the direction of
  no paw twist.

### Holds and reach

- Short arms do not reach the instruments of the app. Size the instrument by the rule of real
  players, and keep the limbs until the user asks for longer arms.
- The arm factor follows the hold. Fit the hold with a first factor, measure the reach, and rig the
  final factor one time.
- A new scale of `SpeciesParams` adds its instrument to `SCALED_INSTRUMENTS`, so the typecheck
  names each reader.
- Check each hold change with `pnpm hold-fit --set`, `pnpm pose-depth --set`, and
  `pnpm arm-check --variant` before you write it, because a hold trades folds against clearance.
- The arm gate and the depths pass while a paw misses its instrument. Measure each grip with
  `pnpm wind-grip`, and look at the thumb, which the tool does not see.
- A paw that points at its tube cannot face it with the palm. Put the grip beside the tube.
- A big head puts the grips at shoulder height. Point the elbows down. A deep trunk takes the room
  of the elbows: point them out.
- A round belly takes the room of short forearms and covers short thighs. Place a floor instrument
  by its contact point, move the keys forward, and lean the spine.
- A long snout puts the mouthpiece far forward. Turn the instrument back around the mouthpiece, or
  move the mouthpiece under the muzzle (`lipShift`).
- Rest elbows far from the play elbows twist the paws in the lift. Keep them near.
- A roll rule that aims at a far point flips when the prop points at it (`rollToward()`).
- `weights.fingers` 0.5 keeps the curl small. A paw that closes around a tube takes the weight 1.

### Bow

- A turned paw moves on an arc around the wrist. Put the bow stick along that arc.
- The paw slides on the stick when the forearm turns against the bow. Turn the hand around a grip in
  the middle of the paw (`stickTurnR`).
- A direct mix from an upright rest bow turns the tip through the head. Use a via (`BowVia`).

### Clearance

- The sweep measures triangle corners, so the middle of a long box can go into the body unseen.
  `bowPoints()` takes a point at each 1 cm of the bow.
- A depth that stays the same over all variants is half the thickness of the obstacle.
- The depth of an open part is false near its edge, so the sweep measures closed parts
  (`closedPart()`).
- The pair "instrument in body" gives the deepest corner. Measure the visible top plate alone.

### Weights and folds

- A goal on one measure moves the twist to a joint that no goal measures. Run the whole gate.
- Bone heat gives the trunk side a part of a hanging arm. Keep the arm weights on the free arm
  (`armSplit`, `armBelow`, `armCrease`).
- A thin face with corners of different weights turns over at a bent joint. `weights.rigid` gives
  it the mean. The `sliver` rule can then move a weight 4 cm away, so compare the weights with
  `main` by place.
- A narrow fade under a far bone turn moves the fold into the fade. Let the fade span several
  rings.
- Add a ring at a joint (`refine.rings`) only where `pnpm fold-probe` finds folds, then run
  `pnpm pose-depth`.
- Automatic weights give the clavicle most of a thick arm root, and the wrist helper half of a
  short paw. Check both.
- Blender weights on the trunk, the head, or the neck fold faces. Keep the rule weights there
  (`paintedLower`).
- The glTF skin has no B-Bones and 4 weights for each vertex. In the Blender preview, set
  `bbone_segments` to 1, turn off Preserve Volume, and run Limit Total 4.
- A second subdivision, a Smooth of the upper arm weights, or a move of the elbow alone does not
  fix a twisted arm.

### Seams and cuts

- A raised arm pulls a seam where a hanging arm touches the trunk into dark flaps. Only a cut at
  the seam fixes them (`cut`). Give the caps the skin normals.
- A flap, a shard, or a dent at a seam is often a source form that the hanging arm hid. No measure
  sees it, so look at the sheets of `pnpm close-views audit`.
- After a cut, the inner root of a bow arm swings into the chest. Give it a chest share
  (`weights.armRoot`).
- End a cut above the shoulder joint, else a black triangle shows on the back.
- An arm joined to the trunk down to the elbow takes a seam cut, a side wall, and a tube with a
  flat inner side (`cat_arms.py`). Take its weights from the copy before the wall.
- A Bisect near a corner leaves thin faces. Collapse their short edges (`step_clean_cut()`).
- Flatten the inner side of a thick upper arm after the bake, never before it.
- Cut a wrist parallel to the last ring, and give the band `rootNormals.wrist`.
- A dark slot at an arm root or an elbow can come from split normals. Render
  `--probe colors,normals`, and try `rootNormals` before a rebuild.

### Shapes

- When no weight rule or ring removes a fold, fit a shape of `raise` with `pnpm raise-fit` on the
  key of its joint. A body has at most `RAISE_LIMIT` shapes.
- A shape fixes only the poses near its rule, so fit the hold first. Keep the rig log count of
  `raise R` at 0.
- A grip far in front of a deep chest turns the shoulder past any shape. Turn the shoulder bone
  forward with the arm (`reachL`).

### Legs, seat, and tail

- Put the hip joints of short thick legs in the haunch. Keep the shin to thigh ratio of the mesh,
  and fit the bench to the legs.
- The linear blend flattens a bent knee. Give the knees `bind.knee`, and smooth the back of the knee
  in few rounds.
- New faces move the bone heat of the whole mesh. Give the kept vertices the old heat
  (`heatSource`).
- Short or sloped thighs set the seat top before the haunch. End the seat where the thighs leave
  it (`chair.front`).
- A tail root moves the seat top. Give the sit a fixed top from the final `--check` (`sit.top`).
- A tail on the floor stays flat with rigid bone turns (`studio.tailBind`). A large tail needs two
  bones.
- A body with no chair keeps its center of mass over its soles: feet under the hips, and the trunk
  leaned forward.

### Head and colors

- A big head over a thin neck shows a dark band. Smooth the neck with a box that ends behind the
  chin.
- A horn, a trunk, whiskers, or antlers distort the head measures. Use `noseTop`, `noseFront`,
  `headFloor`, and `headCeiling`.
- A closed beak cannot open by weights. Split a copy of the source.
- A face takes black from a third of dark samples. Make the border faces light (`colors.border`).
- A face rule can paint a dark block on the side. Check it from the front, at 60°, and each side.
- Measure the packed parts before you cut a palette entry.

### Probes

- Give a kept GLB file of `pnpm rig-mesh --check --keep` to `--glb` of the probes. Never copy it
  over the rig in `assets/`.
- `--views` of `pnpm arm-check` takes no conductor. Aim a camera in JSON at the podium.
- A fix of a turn rate can move a prop to a wrong place with all measures passed. Render a crop of
  the move before you commit.
- Record each row of a variant table with the commit or the `--set` of its run.
- These pose values stay in meters at each body size: the bow values of `src/pose/bowed-rig.ts` and
  `src/pose/strokes.ts`, `HAND_MOTION`, the percussion `sizes`, `CONDUCTOR_MOTION.scale`, and the
  sweep limits. After a change of the body size, compare in `H` first.

## The brief of a rigging round

A manager briefs one implementation agent for each round, with no review agent and no test step.

```text
 manager                 agent                      manager
 +--------------+        +------------------+       +-------------------+
 | baseline,    | -----> | rig, hold fit,   | ----> | report, images,   |
 | inspect,     |        | probes, docs     |       | merge, retro      |
 | brief        |        +------------------+       +-------------------+
 +--------------+
```

### Before the brief

The manager runs these commands on `main` and puts the numbers into the brief:
`pnpm studio-body <a> --inspect`, `pnpm pose-depth <role> --gaps`, `pnpm arm-check <role>`,
`pnpm hold-reach <species> --instrument <id>` (with `--glb <file>` for a new file), and
`pnpm build && pnpm size`. The brief gives the posture of a real player from the technique
references of `docs/reference/`.

- When the violin shop rule gives a violin outside the real sizes, ask the user before the round:
  longer arms or a smaller instrument.
- Start a hold round only after each form round of the same body merges, because a form change
  moves the joints.
- Of two mesh rounds side by side, the second makes its docs commits after the first merges.

### Brief

```markdown
# Brief: the <species> as the <role> of the app

Start commit `<hash>`. <On `main`, or worktree `<path>` on branch `<branch>`>. Handoff
`scratch/handoff-<round>.md`. Time box <minutes>. Read `<scratch>/rules-common.md`.

## Goal
<the request in neutral words>. Done when:
1. `pnpm studio-body <a>` writes the module, and the species has the body.
2. <the pose claims: the seat, the feet, the hold>.
3. The role is in `SWEEP_ROLES`, `FOLD_ROLES`, `ROLE_VIEWS`, and "Bodies and roles".
4. `pnpm arm-check <role> --base <start> --views <dir>` gives no `FAIL`.
5. `tools/check-commits.sh --tip <base>` passed, and the docs checklist is true.

## Facts and baseline
<the output of "Before the brief", and the open form rounds of the body>

## Scale, seat, and poses
<the landmark, the seat that fits the legs, and the posture of a real player with its source>

## Range and stop
<the range of each fallback result. Outside it, stop, and report the measures.>

## Report format
Result. Numbers (| Measure | main | round |, and the gate table). Choices. Commits. Images
(with the crop pairs). Open problems and the next step.
```

### Rules of a round

- Commit the mechanism first, with values that change nothing. Then tune with `--set`, and commit
  the tuned values.
- When a measure chooses a value, check that the reference lies inside the range of the variants.
  Else stop, and send the table to the manager.
- A round that changes a grip on purpose expects a `FAIL` of the grip turn, and gives the new
  median for `ACCEPTED_GRIPS` with the 2x paw crops.
- When two goals conflict, keep this order: the clearance, the arm gate, the range of the
  instrument, and the look of the hold.
- Run `pnpm pose-depth <role> --glb <file> --every 4` on the first variant of a mesh edit.
- Make the images with one batch (`pnpm close-views batch`), from the front, the back, and each
  side, at a note and at rest. Run `pnpm close-views audit` before the report.
- After the commit of the body, run `pnpm test:paused src/shots/` and
  `pnpm body-probe --base <start>`, and give the line of `pnpm size --base <start>`.
- After the merge, ask each agent what would make the next task faster, and apply the items that
  are worth the cost.

### Common rules of the agents

Copy this list into `<scratch>/rules-common.md`.

- Work where the brief says. Read `AGENTS.md` first. On `main`, give the start commit to each
  `--base`.
- Make very fine-grained Conventional Commits, and stage each path by its name.
- Use `perl -0pi -e` for a temporary edit, and the Edit tool for a lasting edit of code.
- Never take ports 5173, 5190, or 4182. Stop each process that you start by its PID.
- Do not edit the working tree while a tool builds the site.
- No merge and no push. End with a clean tree and no rebase in progress.
- Ask no questions when the user is not available. Report each open choice.
- Write all prose in ASD-STE100 Simplified Technical English. Keep the handoff file current.

### Docs checklist

- **A new species.** Design 1 (its reference sheet), 4.3 (the species and the seat heights), 4.4
  (the body and its rig rules), 4.5 (the accent color and the triangles), 4.6 (the instrument
  scale and the reach), 4.7 (the optional bones), 7.1 (`VIEW_SHEETS`), the table "Bodies and
  roles", the traps above, and `assets/models/<s>/README.md` (the source, the license, and the
  checksum).
- **A new role.** The pose index of design 5, the moments of `pnpm close-views` in design 7.1, the
  sweep of design 9.3, and the role column of "Bodies and roles".
- **A new hold.** The pose index of design 5, design 5.2 (the rest), 5.3 (the hold), and 4.6 (the
  reach). Put each choice and its reason into its design section.

The code lists are `ANIMALS`, `STUDIO_BODIES`, `SPECIES`, `SWEEP_ROLES`, `ROLE_VIEWS`,
`FOLD_ROLES`, `SPECIES_HOLDS`, `SPECIES_WIND_HOLDS` with `LEG_RESTS`, and `PERCUSSION_HOLDS`.
