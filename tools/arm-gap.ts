/**
 * Measures how each arm of a mesh rig meets the trunk in the stance of the long-armed source mesh
 * (`standingBody()`), the intake check of `pnpm rig-mesh <animal> --check`. An arm that joins the
 * trunk far down, or that touches it, hides trunk faces that a raised arm then shows as flaps,
 * shards, or dents (`docs/research/2026-10-22-seam-gate.md`). A new mesh in an A-pose, with a gap
 * between each arm and the trunk, has none.
 *
 * - An arm vertex holds {@link GAP_SHARE} or more of its weight on the arm bones of its side, from
 *   the upper arm to the fingers. Its place along the arm is 0 at the shoulder joint, 1 at the
 *   elbow, and 2 at the wrist (the nearest of the two bones). Only the vertices from
 *   {@link GAP_FROM} on count, because the root of each arm joins the trunk.
 * - A trunk vertex of an arm holds less than {@link GAP_SHARE} of its weight on the arm, and
 *   {@link GAP_SHARE} or more on the arm, the hips, the spine, the chest, the neck, and the
 *   clavicles. Thus the skin of the shoulder that the arm moves in part counts as trunk. A trunk face
 *   has three trunk corners.
 * - The join of an arm is the range of the places of the counted arm vertices with an edge to a
 *   trunk vertex: the skin goes on from the arm into the trunk there. Its end is the depth of the
 *   armpit. The arm joins the trunk when the end is past {@link JOIN_LIMIT}.
 * - The gap of an arm is the smallest distance from a counted arm vertex below the join (from its
 *   end plus {@link GAP_BELOW}) to a trunk face. The arm touches the trunk below {@link TOUCH_GAP}.
 *
 * Usage: node tools/arm-gap.ts [<animal>...]: the values of the rig of each config of
 * `tools/mesh-rigs/` (all with no animal), from the GLB file of the rig in `assets/models/`.
