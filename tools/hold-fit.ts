/**
 * Fits the hold of a role of a studio body in one run (`docs/agents/rigging.md`, "Holds and
 * reach"): for the base and for each variant of `--set`, it gives the folds of `pnpm fold-probe`
 * with the most folded faces of one rest sample by side, the deepest point of each sample set of
 * the sweep of `pnpm pose-depth` with the note-target errors, and, for a violin role, the reach of
 * `pnpm hold-reach`. For a role that holds its instrument against its body, it gives the deepest
 * point of the instrument in the body. For a wind role with a paw that leaves its grip in the rest
 * pose (`WindHold.restFreeL`), it gives the gap of that paw to the body in the rest and the reach
 * share of its rest place. It prints one table with one row for each variant. The source files do
 * not change.
 *
 * `--grid '<path>=<a>:<b>:<step>'` adds the variants of a range of values, and several `--grid`
 * options give the product of their ranges. With `--set`, the grids go on top of each variant of
 * `--set`, and the run has no row of a `--set` variant alone. The limit is {@link GRID_LIMIT}
 * variants. A run with a grid sorts the rows of the variants by the play folds, then by the
 * deepest point. With `--faces <n>`,
 * the faces that fold most in the base and in the best variant follow the table, as
 * `pnpm fold-probe --faces` writes them. `--faces-of <face>[,<face>]...` adds a column for each
 * named face with the share of the play samples in which it folds (`tools/face-shares.ts`). Each
 * row also names the {@link TOP_FOLDS} faces that fold in the most samples, with the mark `new` at
 * a face that folds in no sample of the base row of the working tree ({@link topFolds}).
 *
 * With `--base <ref>`, the commit and the working tree run at the same time, each in a child
 * process. The table then starts with the row of the commit, and one compare of the deepest
 * points in the H of each body follows for each variant.
 *
 * `--sets <set>[,<set>]...` takes only the named sample sets of {@link FIT_SETS}, such as
 * `--sets lift,rest,lower` for the rest mode: the run then skips the play samples of the folds
 * and of the sweep, which take most of its time.
 *
 * A run with the rest set gives the lap rest of a seated role with a lap rest ({@link hasLapRest}):
 * the gap of the lower end of the instrument to the skin of the thighs, and for a violin role the
 * tilt of the violin, the place of the left palm on it, the upright bow at the right side, and the
 * place of the right elbow (`tools/lap-rest.ts`).
 *
 * A wind role gives the spare reach of each grip in the play and in the rest (`spareRow()` of
 * `pnpm hold-reach`).
 *
 * `--technique <technique>` counts only the play samples of the folds, the turns, and the sweep in
 * which the last note of the seat of the player has the technique, such as `pizzicato`
 * ({@link techniqueFilter}). The note targets and the lap rest count all samples.
 *
 * `--scan` scans variants of the rest of a role with a lap rest or a wind hold in a part of the
 * time: for each variant, it builds only the rig of one seated player again, and measures one rest
 * sample at the wall time `SCAN_WALL` of `tools/lap-rest.ts`, or one sample at each wall time of
 * `--walls` ({@link scanHolds}). With no `--demo`, the sample is the first seated body of the role in the
 * first demo of the run. It goes with `--set`, `--grid` (up to {@link SCAN_GRID_LIMIT} variants),
 * and `--demo`.
 *
 * `--glb <file>` fits the hold on the studio body that the export makes from another GLB file, such
 * as a GLB file of `pnpm rig-mesh --check --keep`: the tool runs again in a child process, in a copy
 * of `src/` with the module of the file (`withGlbBody()` of `tools/glb-swap.ts`). The files of
 * `assets/` and `src/` do not change, also after a stop or a failure. It goes with each option
 * except `--base`.
 *
 * Usage: pnpm hold-fit <role> [--set <path>=<value>[;<path>=<value>]...]...
 * [--grid <path>=<a>:<b>:<step>]... [--sets <set>[,<set>]...] [--demo <id>|all]...
 * [--midi <path>]... [--step <seconds>] [--faces <n>] [--base <ref>] [--json <file>] [--glb <file>], or pnpm hold-fit
 * <role> --scan [--walls <seconds>[,<seconds>]...] [--set <changes>]... [--grid <grid>]...
 * [--demo <id>|all]... [--midi <path>]... [--glb <file>]
 *
 * Each `--midi <path>` adds a MIDI file of the user to the run as one more `--demo`.
