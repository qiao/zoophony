/**
 * Finds the clips of the players of a MIDI file over the whole song (design 9.3): the parts that
 * go into each other, which no sweep of one role sees. A sample is a time of the play from the song
 * start to the song end, at steps of `--step` seconds, with the count-in first, as the sweep plays
 * it (`playSample()` of `src/pose/test-sweep-roles.ts`). The measures:
 *
 * - `seats`: the pairs of items of the layout whose footprints overlap (`layoutObstacles()`): two
 *   players with their instruments and seats, a stand, the podium, or the risers.
 * - `paw in paw`: the depth of the corners of one paw of a player in the other paw, closed with a
 *   cap at the wrist, such as the wide paws of a pianist on near keys.
 * - `held across`: a mallet, a stick, or a beater of one hand that crosses the other paw or the
 *   held part of the other hand. A thin part can cross another part with no corner inside it, so
 *   this measure counts the samples where the triangles cross.
 * - `in instrument`: the depth of the paws, of the shafts of the held parts, and of the middle of
 *   each mallet head in the closed shells of the own instrument: the piano case off the keys
 *   (`pianoCase()`), or each closed shell of a percussion instrument. A head lies on its target at
 *   a strike, so only its middle counts.
 * - `under floor`: the depth of the lowest corner of the instrument and of the held parts below the
 *   floor under the player.
 * - `between players`: the arms, the held parts, and the instrument of a player that cross the arms,
 *   the held parts, or the instrument of a near player, or go into the boxes of its other bones in
 *   the bind pose (one box for each bone in each band of height, as `playerFootprint()` makes).
 *
 * A measure clips when more than {@link SHARE_LIMIT} of the samples are over its limit. The files
 * are each demo and the percussion test score (`probeDemos()`), the demos of `--demo`, or the MIDI
 * files of `--midi`. With `--base <ref>`, the commit runs beside the working tree
 * (`probeBeside()`), and each value gives the value of the commit in parentheses.
 *
 * Usage: pnpm clip-probe [--midi <path>]... [--demo <id>]... [--step <s>] [--jobs <n>]
 *        [--base <ref>] [--json <file>]
