/**
 * Prints the rate of each beat-driven and note-driven motion of the body over a whole song
 * (design 5.1, 5.4): the notated beat, the conducted beat, the sway of the spine, the sway of a
 * singer, the preparatory beat of the count-in (the nod of a leader), the turns of the cues, and
 * the bow changes. The sway rates come from the poses of `poseAt()` at each `--step`, so the tool
 * measures what the viewer sees, on each tree. A side of a sway is the time between two zero
 * crossings of its angle, and its tempo is 60 divided by that time.
 *
 * A row with a limit gives the song time over the limit: the sum of the events faster than the
 * limit (with {@link LIMIT_SLACK}), for the player with the most. The sway and the singer sway take `--limit`, and the
 * conducted beat takes {@link CONDUCTED_LIMIT}. The verdict is `FAIL` when a row has more than
 * {@link MAX_OVER_SEC} over its limit, and the tool then exits with 1. With `--base <ref>`, the
 * commit and the working tree run at the same time, each in a child process (`probeBeside()`),
 * and the tool prints one table for each file with the values of both.
 *
 * `--trace <from>-<to>` prints the side sway of the spine of one player of one file at steps of
 * {@link TRACE_STEP} ({@link traceLines}): the player of `--player`, or the player with the largest
 * sway in the range. With `--base`, the commit runs this script of the working tree, so that both
 * trees give the same measure, and each line gives the angle of both.
 *
 * Usage: pnpm beat-rates [--midi <path>]... [--demo <id>]... [--limit <bpm>] [--step <s>]
 *        [--base <ref>] [--json <file>], or
 *        pnpm beat-rates --midi <path> | --demo <id> --trace <from>-<to> [--player <n>]
 *        [--base <ref>]
 * With no `--midi` and no `--demo`, it probes each demo.
