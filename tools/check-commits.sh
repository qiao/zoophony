#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Usage: tools/check-commits.sh [--tip] [--no-cache] <base>
#
# Checks each commit of <base>..HEAD with the checks of a merge, and keeps the result of each
# passed commit in a cache that each worktree shares: $(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)/check-cache/.
# The result of a check is a fact of the tree, so a commit with a known key prints "hit" and runs
# no check. Each other commit prints the time of each check.
#
# tools/check-cache.ts gives the plan and the key of each commit. The key holds the tree of the
# commit, the tree of its parent, the check commands, the hash of this script and of the module,
# the versions of Node and pnpm, ZOOPHONY_BASE, and the hash of the installed lockfile. A commit
# that changes code runs the lint, the typecheck, the unit tests that its changes reach, and the
# format check. A commit that changes only docs/ and Markdown files runs the format check and the
# tests that read docs paths.
#
# --tip also runs the full unit suite on the last commit. --no-cache reads no entry, and it
# still writes an entry for each passed check. Only this script writes an entry, after each
# check of the commit exits with 0 on an unchanged tree, through a temporary file and `mv`.
#
# The checks run in a temporary detached worktree of HEAD, which the script adds only when a
# commit has no entry. The script never changes the checkout where you call it, and it needs no
# clean tree there: an edit during the run changes no check. The temporary worktree gets a link to
# the node_modules of the caller when its installed lockfile is the lockfile of HEAD, else
# `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile --offline`. The script and the module run from a copy in a
# temporary folder, because the caller can edit them during the run.
#
# The script refuses a range with a merge commit, because the checks of a commit read only the
# diff to its first parent. It stops with 4 when HEAD of the caller moved during the run. The
# temporary worktree goes away after a pass, after a failure, and after a stop (INT or TERM). A
# `kill -9` leaves it: `git worktree list` shows it, and `git worktree remove --force` removes it.
#
# Exit codes: 1 bad use or bad state, 3 a check failed (the branch is unchanged), 4 HEAD moved
# during the run, 130 a stop.
