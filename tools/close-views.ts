/**
 * The close views of the roles (design 7.1):
 *
 * - The conductor: the front, the right side, and the back, which the default view of the stage
 *   shows (design 2.5), at the four beats of the first bar of the default test notes (4/4 at 120
 *   BPM), between two beats, and in the rest pose. The conductor keeps its fixed line.
 * - The pianist: the front, both sides, the back, and the left paw on the keys. The moments are
 *   a chord of three keys in each hand, a time between two chords, the lowest keys, the highest
 *   keys, and the rest pose. The camera turns around the body. It looks down 35°, over the case
 *   of the piano in the front view. The view of the keys is low from the left, 15° to the front.
 * - The deer harpist on its stool: the front, both sides, the back, and the left hand at the
 *   strings from the front left. The moments are a chord of two strings in each hand just before
 *   the pluck, the time after the pluck, the rest pose, and halfway through the lift and the
 *   lowering at the chord. The side views, the back view, and a low view from the back right also
 *   show the haunch on the seat of the stool and the puff tail.
 * - The violinist: the front, both sides, and the back. The moments are the frog and the tip of a
 *   whole bow on the A string, a string crossing from the G string to the E string, the rest
 *   pose, halfway through the lift and the lowering at the frog ({@link halfMoves}), and the
 *   standing soloist at the frog.
 * - The red fox violinist of the second violins: the views and the moments of the violinist. The
 *   side views and the back view also show the tail, which goes back over the seat and through
 *   the open back of the chair.
 * - The cat violist of the violas: the views and the moments of the violinist, with a whole
 *   down-bow on the A string and a string crossing from the C string to the A string.
 * - The dog cellist of the cellos: the front, both sides, and the back. The moments are the frog
 *   and the tip of a whole down-bow on the A string, a string crossing from the C string to the A
 *   string, the rest pose, and halfway through the lift and the lowering at the frog. A cellist
 *   does not stand.
 * - The hippo bassist of the contrabasses, who stands: the views and the moments of the cellist,
 *   with a whole down-bow on the G string and a string crossing from the E string to the G
 *   string.
 * - The tan fox flutist: the front, both sides, and the back. The moments are a long note, a time
 *   between two phrases, the rest pose, halfway through the lift and the lowering at the note,
 *   and the standing soloist at the note.
 * - The panda trombonist: the front, both sides, and the back. The moments are a note in the
 *   first position, a note in the seventh position at the end of the reach of the slide, the rest
 *   pose, halfway through the lift and the lowering at the first note, and the standing soloist.
 * - The mouse oboist: the views and the moments of the flutist. The side views and the back view
 *   also show the long tail, which goes back from the haunch and lies on the floor behind the
 *   mouse, which has no chair.
 * - The elephant timpanist, who stands: the front, both sides, and the back. The moments are a
 *   strike of the left mallet on the front kettle at the left of the trunk, a strike of the right
 *   mallet on the front kettle at its right, a time between two strikes, the top of the lift
 *   of the right mallet before its strike, the rest pose, and halfway through the lift and the
 *   lowering at the first strike. The camera looks down 30°, as a seat of the hall looks at the
 *   back row.
 * - The beaver bassoonist: the views and the moments of the flutist. The side views and the back
 *   view also show the broad tail, which goes back from the haunch and lies on the floor behind
 *   the beaver, which has no chair.
 * - The pig hornist: the views and the moments of the flutist. The left paw presses the valves
 *   in the phrase, and the right paw stays in the bell.
 * - The wolf clarinetist: the views and the moments of the flutist. The side views and the back
 *   view also show the bushy tail, which goes back over the seat and hangs down behind it.
 * - The monkey trumpeter: the views and the moments of the flutist. The right paw presses the
 *   valves in the phrase. The side views and the back view also show the long tail, which goes
 *   back and down to its curl on the floor behind the monkey, which has no chair.
 * - The rhino tubist, who stands: the views and the moments of the flutist, with no standing
 *   soloist, because each tubist stands. The right paw presses the valves in the phrase. The side
 *   views and the back view also show the thin tail, which hangs down behind the haunch.
 * - The penguin singer of the choir, who stands on its riser: the front, both sides, and the back.
 *   The moments are an open beak in a note, a closed beak between two notes, and the rest pose,
 *   with the default test notes. The flippers hold the folder in each moment.
 * - The badger of the percussion, who stands: one role for each instrument, with the front, both
 *   sides, and the back. The moments are a strike of each hand or a crash, a time between two
 *   strikes, the rest pose, and halfway through the lift and the lowering at the first strike.
 *   The bass drummer strikes with the beater in the right paw, the snare drummer and the
 *   xylophonist alternate their paws, the percussionist strikes the triangle in its left paw and
 *   then the tambourine, and the xylophonist strikes the lowest and the highest bars.
 *
 * A new role gives its species, its views, its moments, and its test notes, with the camera
 * `{ kind: 'body', zoom: 1, elevation }`.
