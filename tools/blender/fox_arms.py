"""Replays the Blender session that rebuilt the arms of the fox (the red fox violinist and the tan
fox flutist, one rig).

On 2026-10-24 the user allowed loop edges, retopology, and extra bones for the arm and wrist twist
("add loop edges and retopology and additional bones if needed to address them"). The wind arm
round measured a twist step of 63.7 degrees on the left forearm of the tan fox, and the fox rig had
only the four old arm bones. The inner side of the fox upper arm joins the trunk down to the
armpit at about 0.6 of the upper arm. A cut at a right angle to the bone then runs down the side
of the trunk, and its bridge faces turned over in the seated bind. So the session of 2026-10-25
used the steps of `cat_arms.py`, in a headless Blender, with check images after the steps:

1. Import the mesh of the user and Merge by Distance.
2. Cut each arm along the seam where it meets the trunk and at the wrist, fill a side wall of the
   trunk under the arm, collapse the thin faces at the cut loops, and model a quad tube with a flat
   inner side on the wall.
3. Shrinkwrap, Bridge Edge Loops, Beautify Faces, Collapse Edges on the thin bridge faces, UV,
   the bake of the fur color, and the transfer of the custom normals.
4. Make each arm `factor` times longer (`armFactor` 1.21 of the rig config before), put the arm
   image in a strip of the atlas, give the inner side the fur color of the trunk, and write
   `fox-arms.glb`.
5. Add the studio skeleton with the arm segments and the helpers, parent with automatic weights,
   and paint the fixes of `cat_arms.step_paint()` with the Weight Paint tools. The fingers keep half
   of their weight (`step_fingers()`), as the rule `weights.fingers` of the old rig.
6. Write the weights for `paintedWeights` of the config (`fox-weights.json`).

The red fox and the tan fox share the rig, so one session serves both roles. The tan fox keeps its
palette of the same faces (`paletteMap()` of `tools/studio-palette.ts`).

Run it in a terminal from the root of the tree:

    Blender -b --factory-startup -P tools/blender/fox_arms.py -- [<out dir>] [--views <dir>]

A run gives the same `fox-arms.glb` and `fox-weights.json`, byte for byte. `--views <dir>` writes
the check images of `cat_arms.look()`.

#: at |x| 0.093, and the free arm starts at |x| 0.113, so the seam plane stands at |x| 0.1. The
#: shoulder has no ring (`seam.rings`): two rings packed at the short socket folded into a dark slit
#: at the back of the arm root. The first ring of the tube takes Blender weights (`seam.ruled` 0).
#: The tube near the side walls takes a chest share of 0.4 (`anchor`): with 0.2, the right arm of the
#: red fox folded 9 to 11 faces at rest. `fingers`: the share of the weight of each finger bone that
#: the fingers keep (`step_fingers()`).
