"""Replays the Blender session that rebuilt the arms of the polar bear pianist.

On 2026-10-24 the user saw the rebuilt arms of the Rigify rabbit and said: "now apply similar
techniques to the polars bear". The session made these steps in the live Blender through MCP,
with an image after each step, and this script repeats them in the same order:

1. Import the T-pose mesh of the user (`polar-bear-tpose.glb`) and Merge by Distance.
2. Replace the faces of each arm from the shoulder line to the wrist with a quad tube: Bisect at
   the shoulder line and at the wrist (parallel to the last ring of the tube, since 2026-10-28),
   Delete Faces, Collapse Edges of the thin faces at each wrist cut loop, a tube of
   `len(stations)` rings of `RING_VERTS`, Shrinkwrap onto the source arm, Bridge Edge Loops to the
   trunk and to the paw, and Collapse Edges of the thin wrist bridge faces. The faces of the paws,
   the trunk, the legs, and the head stay.
3. Give the new arm faces a UV layout, bake the fur color of the source arm onto them (Cycles,
   Selected to Active), and transfer the custom normals of the source surface (Data Transfer).
4. Put the arm image in a strip below the atlas, so that the mesh keeps one material, and write
   the new source `polar-bear-arms.glb`.
5. Add the studio skeleton with the arm segments and the elbow and wrist helpers
   (`armSegments` of `tools/mesh-rigs/polar-bear.json`), parent with automatic weights, and paint
   the fixes with the Weight Paint tools (`paint_weights()`).
6. Write the weights for `paintedWeights` of the config (`polar-bear-weights.json`).

Then `pnpm rig-mesh polar-bear` and `pnpm studio-body polar-bear` make the app body. The app
drives the segments and the helpers from the joints of the pose (`poseArm()` of
`src/models/studio-rig.ts`).

Run it in a terminal from the root of the tree:
