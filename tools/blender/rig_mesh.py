"""Rigs a textured mesh with no skeleton into the GLB format of a studio body (design 4.4).

    blender -b --factory-startup --python tools/blender/rig_mesh.py -- <config.json> <out.glb> \
        [--preview <dir>] [--obj <file>] [--faces <file>] [--corners <file>] [--check]

`pnpm rig-mesh <animal>` runs this script with `tools/mesh-rigs/<animal>.json`. The output has
the format of `lowpoly-studio/animals/<animal>/out/<animal>.glb`, so that `pnpm studio-body`
reads it (route 3 of `docs/agents/model-work.md`). The steps:

1. Import the source GLB file, weld the corners, and scale the mesh to 1 unit from the soles to
   the top, with the soles at y = 0. The math uses the axes of the studio: y up, +z forward, and
   +x the left side of the animal. With `proportions` of the config, the mesh then takes a factor
   on each axis (`width` on x, `height` on y, `depth` on z), so that a body can be shorter or
   wider than the mesh of the user before the joints. With `keep` of the rule set to `head`, the
   head keeps its form, and a blend zone at the neck joins it to the scaled body
   (`proportioned()`). The head keeps its size, or takes the factor `head` of the rule on each
   axis. With `cut` of the config, the faces that join each hanging
   forearm to the belly go, and new faces close both holes (`cut_seam()`). With `fins` of the
   cut, each kept face that sticks into the hole with two edges also goes (`cut_fins()`), so
   that no cap repeats it. A copy of the mesh
   that removed these faces and closed the arm itself leaves only the hole of the trunk open,
   and the cut closes that hole (`open_loop()`). With `skinNormals` of
   the cut, the file names the caps of the arm, and the app gives them the normals of the skin.
   With `bodyNormals`, the sides of the cut such as "R", the file also names the caps of the body,
   the quads at the top, and the skin faces of their rim (`cut_rim()`) of these sides, which take
   the normals of the skin too.
2. Give each face one color from the base color texture. A face of an eye keeps its dark color.
3. Build the skeleton of the 30 body bones of the studio at the joints of the config, with the
   optional bone `tail_tip` for a tail of two bones and the optional bone `jaw` for a beak that
   opens, and give the weights with bone heat. Then the rules of the config: the free arm (beyond a plane, which `armFree` turns around the vertical
   for a thick arm that joins the trunk, with each island inside the plane that only the free arm
   surrounds with `armIslands`, and only the arm bones on a free arm that is a tube of its own
   with `armOwn`), the chest share of the inner root of a cut arm (`armRoot`),
   the clavicles below the shoulders and the arms up the neck,
   the clavicles over the top of the shoulders (`shoulderRamp`), the paw, the head and the
   shoulders, the ears, the lower beak on the jaw (`jaw`), a long nose in front of the chest
   (`noseFront`), the tail (a ball on one
   tail bone, or a ramp along a tail of two bones), the haunch, one set of weights for the corners of each short thin face, and the weights of the
   line for the middle corner of each long thin face. Each vertex
   keeps four bones, in steps of 1/255. With `smooth` of the config, the vertices inside a box
   first move toward the middle of their neighbors (`smooth_box()`), before the weights. The file
   then gives the move of the head center back to the head before the smoothing (`head_shift()`),
   so that the holds keep their places.
4. Make the upper arm and the forearm longer by the arm factor of the config, and the thigh and
   the shin by the leg factor. Each bone scales along its axis, and the weights blend the stretch
   to 0 at the shoulder and at the hip. The paws and the feet keep their size, and the body rises
   so that the soles stay at y = 0. The head and the ears grow by the head factor around the neck
   joint, and the weights blend the growth over the neck. The trunk takes the trunk factor
   between the hips joint and the neck joint (`trunk_moves()`), and the head, the arms, the legs,
   and the tail move with it and keep their sizes. The trunk and the clavicles take the girth
   factors across the trunk axis, one for the width and one for the depth (`girth_moves()`), and
   the arms, the legs, and the tail move out with their joints and keep their sizes. With
   `armGirth` of the config, the upper arm and the forearm take its factors across their axes
   (`arm_slim()`, `fore_slim()`): the factor of the upper arm fades in from the shoulder joint,
   and the factor of the forearm fades out to the wrist, so that the shoulders and the paws keep
   their form.
5. Change the faces of the arms so that they bend at the joints: a ring of new vertices at each
   joint of the config splits the faces that it crosses, and the long edge of a face that is
   thin in the seated bind pose flips. Each face then takes its color from the texture again.
6. Pose the skeleton in the seated bind pose: the legs turn by the seat of the config, the arms
   go to the bind arms of the studio, and the bones of a tail of two bones go to the bind
   directions of the config, back through the open back of the chair. The skin of the
   long-armed source in this pose is the bind mesh: a linear blend, or with `bind.blend` of
   the config a dual quaternion blend at the arm roots (`bind_skin()`). Where the pose turns
   faces over, as at the haunch, their vertices relax toward their neighbors. The log then gives the gap from the
   lowest point of the haunch behind the hips joint to the seat top, and above 5 cm a warning
   with a front edge of the chair that puts the seat under the haunch (`haunch_gap()`). With
   `sit` of the config, the underside of the haunch behind the hip joints goes down onto the seat
   (`sit()`). With `studio.trunk`,
   the trunk then reclines: the pelvis turns back around the head of the hips until the hip
   angle opens by `open` degrees (`trunk_turn()`), or forward for a negative `open`, each trunk
   bone takes its share of the turn,
   the haunch and the root of the tail rise onto the seat top with a `sit` rule
   (`seat_lift()`), and the tip of a
   tail of two bones keeps the height of its end. With `crease`, the bind is smoothed across the
   crease where the belly meets the top of each thigh (`crease_relax()`).
7. Put a gloss shell over each eye: a fan from the middle of the eye to the edge of its dark
   faces, a little out of the surface. `pnpm studio-body` finds each eye by its fan, drops the
   fan, and puts the pea eye of the app at its place (design 4.5). The faces of the nose become
   gloss. A mesh with no nose of its own, such as the hippo with its two nostrils, has no
   `noseBox`, and its faces keep the fur. The log gives each dark patch that an eye box takes only in part, and warns when the
   box takes more than half of it (`eye_patches()`). Each face takes the nearest color of a
   palette in Oklab. Then each face of the old eye
   (the dark faces and the faces near them, such as the white of the eye, `old_eye_faces()`) takes
   the color with the largest area in the ring of faces around the old eye (`recolor_old_eyes()`),
   so that no outline of the old eye shows. Each patch of dark faces near an old eye that no old
   eye holds, such as the end of the upper lid line of the fox, takes the color of its own ring in
   the same way (`dark_faces_near()`). With `colors.tone`, the plain fur moves in Oklab
   (`tone()`). With `colors.border`, each dark face of a box whose texture is mostly light takes
   the color of the nearest light face (`border_faces()`). Then `colors.patch` makes each eye
   patch round (`patch_shape()`), and `colors.smile` draws a smile line in the dark of the
   patches, or in its own `color` (`smile_line()`). Last, `colors.shift` moves the faces of a colored fur in Oklch
   (`shift_colors()`). The faces go in the order of a walk over their shared edges.
8. Find the corrective shapes: the move of each vertex in the bind pose that the skin of the clip
   `reference` takes to the source place. The arm vertices give `arm_down_L` and `arm_down_R`,
   and the other vertices give `legs_straight_L` and `legs_straight_R`. With `raise` of the
   config, the shape of each rule follows, such as `arm_raise_R` (`raise_rules()`): the move
   that relaxes the faces which the skin turns over in the pose of the rule (`raise_shape()`).
   `raise` holds one rule, or a list of up to four rules for a raised arm or a bent wrist.
   With `upperTwist` of the config, the solve of each shape gives each upper arm the twist bone of
   the app (`upper_twist()`), and the file names the share for `pnpm studio-body`.
9. Write the GLB file with the code of this script: the materials `fur`, `gloss`, and `chair`,
   the skinned mesh with its morph targets, the skeleton, the clip `reference` with one key, a
   chair under the seated body, and the facts that `pnpm studio-body` reads in the extras of the
   asset. When `colors.shift` moves a face, `COLOR_1` holds the colors before the shift, from
   which `pnpm studio-body` maps the other palettes. The bytes depend only on the config and the
   source file.

With `--preview`, the script also renders the seated bind and the standing body from four sides,
the knees of the seated body from the side, the neck from four sides, and the main bone of each
face, and it writes the long-armed source as `source-long-arms.obj` for the probes of
`docs/research/`. With `--obj`, it
writes only the long-armed source, into the file, for `pnpm rig-mesh --check`. With `--check`, it
also lists the faces that the stretch turns or squeezes (`stretch_faces()`) and the long thin faces
across an arm joint that no ring cuts (`uncut_faces()`), before the fold probe of the check. It
gives the share of the dark faces outside the eye and nose boxes, and warns above `DARK_SHARE`
with a dark limit that brings the share under it (`dark_check()`). The flag changes no byte of
the rig. With `--faces`, it also writes the middle of each face of the
module in the units of the source into the file as JSON (`face_sources()`), for
`pnpm fold-probe --faces`. With `--corners`, it writes the corners of the source face of each face
of the module, in the source and in the long-armed source (`face_corners()`), for `pnpm arm-look`.

    also give the turn `turns.hand` of the paw from the forearm, so that the wrist bends as in the

    it. The relaxed vertices are the vertices of the clavicle, the upper arm, the forearm, and the
    forearm twist bone of the side.

    The shapes of the rules before this rule on the same side (`earlier`, each a rule and its
    shape) have their weights in the pose of this rule (`raise_weight()`), as in the app, so that
    the shapes add up to the relaxed places.
