"""Replays the Blender session that rebuilt the arms of the rabbit violinist and the cat violist.

On 2026-10-24 the user said: "note that there's significant twisting happening for the arms and
wrists. add loop edges and retopology and additional bones if needed to address them". The
session made these steps in the live Blender through MCP, with an image after each step, and this
script repeats them in the same order, as `polar_bear_arms.py` of the branch `polar-bear-arms`
does for the polar bear:

1. Import the mesh of the user and Merge by Distance.
2. Replace the faces of each arm from the shoulder line to the wrist with a quad tube: Bisect at
   the shoulder line and at the wrist, Delete Faces, a tube of rings of `RING_VERTS`, Shrinkwrap
   onto the source arm, Bridge Edge Loops to the trunk and to the paw, and Beautify Faces on the
   bridge triangles. The faces of the paws, the trunk, the legs, and the head stay.
3. Give the new arm faces a UV layout, bake the fur color of the source arm onto them (Cycles,
   Selected to Active), and transfer the custom normals of the source surface (Data Transfer).
4. Give the arms the cross-section and the length of the app body (`step_shape()`), put the arm
   image in a strip on top of the atlas, so that the mesh keeps one material, and write the new
   source `<animal>-arms.glb`.
5. Add the studio skeleton with the arm segments and the elbow and wrist helpers (`armSegments`
   of the rig config), parent with automatic weights, and paint the fixes with the Weight Paint
   tools (`paint_weights()`).
6. Write the weights for `paintedWeights` of the config (`<animal>-weights.json`).

Then `pnpm rig-mesh <animal>` and `pnpm studio-body <animal>` make the app body. The app turns the
segments and the helpers from the joints of the pose (`poseArm()` of `src/models/studio-rig.ts`).

Run it in a terminal from the root of the tree:

    Blender -b --factory-startup -P tools/blender/violin_arms.py -- <animal> [<out dir>]

In the live Blender of MCP, `run_steps()` runs one step at a time.

#: (upper arm, forearm), and `slim`: the factors of their cross-sections, which `step_shape()`
#: gives the mesh. The joints of the config are the joints of the shaped arm, and its `armFactor` is 1, because the rig with arm segments
