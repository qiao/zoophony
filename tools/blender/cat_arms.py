"""Replays the Blender session that rebuilt the arms of the cat violist.

On 2026-10-24 the user said: "note that there's significant twisting happening for the arms and
wrists. add loop edges and retopology and additional bones if needed to address them", and allowed
loop edges, a retopology, and extra bones for the arm and the wrist twist. The cat needs more than
the route of `violin_arms.py`: the upper arm of the user mesh joins the side of the trunk down to
the elbow, so a cut at a right angle to the bone finds no closed loop around the arm. This script
gives the cat a real armpit:

1. Import the mesh of the user and Merge by Distance (`violin_arms.import_mesh()`).
2. Cut each arm along the seam where it meets the trunk, not at a right angle to the bone: Bisect
   with the plane of the seam (`seam_plane()`) above the old armpit, and Bisect at the wrist. The
   faces of the arm beyond the seam and the wrist go (Delete Faces).
3. Split the hole of the seam at the height `seam.edge` into the top arc (the shoulder) and the
   lower run. A new edge run across the plane, the armpit line, closes the lower run, and Fill
   (Beauty) makes the side wall of the trunk under the arm from them.
4. Model a quad tube of rings of `RING_VERTS` from the shoulder to the wrist. Each ring stands at a
   right angle to its bone. Where a ring of the upper arm goes into the trunk, its vertices lie on
   the plane of the seam: the flat inner side of the upper arm lies on the side wall, and the two
   meet only at the armpit line. Shrinkwrap puts the other vertices on the source arm.
5. Bridge Edge Loops joins the first ring to the top arc and the armpit line, and the last ring to
   the paw. Beautify Faces runs on the bridge triangles.
6. UV, bake, normals, the shape of the app body, the atlas, and the export, as in
   `violin_arms.py`. Smooth Vertices rounds the two edges of the flat inner side. The inner side
   and the side wall take the fur color of the trunk beside the seam. Before the atlas, the
   trunk moves to an even oval from the front and from the side (`step_belly()`). The user said
   "make the cat's belly more oval and smooth" on 2026-10-27. Then the side wall gets vertices
   inside it and rounds into the trunk, with no lips at its lower tip (`step_round_wall()`).
7. The studio skeleton with the arm segments and the helpers, automatic weights, and the Weight
   Paint fixes of `step_paint()`.
8. Write the weights for `paintedWeights` of the config (`cat-weights.json`).

Run it in a terminal from the root of the tree:

    Blender -b --factory-startup -P tools/blender/cat_arms.py -- [<out dir>] [--views <dir>]

A run gives the same `cat-arms.glb` and `cat-weights.json`, byte for byte. `--views <dir>` writes
check images of the arms after each step of the mesh, and the part codes of each vertex.

#: The settings of the cat, in the units of the studio (1 unit from the soles to the ear tips).
#: `seam`: the cut along the seam and the armpit:
#:
#: - `x`, `lean`: the plane of the seam, |x| from the middle plane at the height `armpit`, and its
#:   lean out for each unit of height down, as the side of the trunk widens below the armpit.
#: - `low`: the lowest height of the cut, below the old armpit. `reach`: the distance from the
#:   forearm line of a face of the free arm below `low`. `under` (optional): a face below `low`
#:   is also out from |x| `under.x` plus `under.lean` for each unit of height below `low`, so that
#:   a round belly under a thick forearm stays on the trunk (the hippo). `hole` (optional): the
#:   reach of the hole of the seam from the upper arm line, 0.16 by default.
#: - `edge`, `armpit`: the heights of the ends and of the middle of the armpit line. Equal heights
#:   give a straight line.
#: - `lift`: the place of the flat inner side of the arm from the side wall: a small depth in the
#:   trunk, so that the front and the back of the arm root stay against the trunk with no slit.
#: - `rings`: the blend shares of the rings of the shoulder from the socket to the first ring.
#:   `ruled`: the number of those rings that keep the rule weights of the config. `ramp`: the
#:   number of rounds of Smooth on the weights of the tube. `round`: the rounds of Smooth Vertices
#:   on the edges of the flat side. `wrap`: the limit of the Shrinkwrap.
#:
#: `anchor`: the share of the chest on the tube near the side walls (`anchor()`).
#:
#: `belly`: the even oval of the trunk (`step_belly()`), in shares `f` of the line from the hips
#: joint to the neck joint of the config. `front`: the two ends of the ellipse arc of the belly
#: front in the side view. `sides`: the two ends of the even curve of each side in the front view,
#: and `bend` the weight of its bends. `step`: the distance of the cuts along the line, in units.
#: `round`: the share of the move of the belly front toward the half ellipse of its cut, and the
#: shares of the half width where the move starts and ends its fade to the sides. `flat`
#: (optional): the shares `f` of the line, the angles from the front, and the largest move in
#: units of the flatter front of the upper belly.
#:
#: `wall` (optional): the round side wall (`step_round_wall()`). `lip`, `depth`, and `over`: a
#: trunk face at the lower run of the old wall is a lip when the dot product of its normal with
#: the normal of the plane of the seam is at most `lip`, it lies within `depth` units of the
#: plane, and at most `over` units over the armpit line. `grid`: the side of the triangles of the
#: new wall in units. `rings` and `reach`: the rings of trunk vertices around the wall that move,
#: within `reach` units of a vertex of the wall. `rounds`: the rounds of Smooth Vertices. `deep`:
#: the largest depth of a vertex of the wall in the trunk.
#:
#: The other keys are the keys of `violin_arms.ANIMALS`.

def step_belly(s):
    """Makes the trunk an even oval from the front and from the side (`belly`).

    The trunk of the user mesh is not an even oval. In the side view, the chest is upright, and
    the belly leans out below it to a peak at 0.33 of the trunk line, with a steep step at its
    lower end. In the front view, the sides are a straight cone with a corner at the hips and a
    notch below each side wall. Along the middle line, the belly has a ridge. The trunk factor of
    the rig (`trunkFactor` 0.686) makes each turn steeper, and the seat shows them as a pinch at
    the waist and a lump below it (`docs/research/2026-10-27-cat-belly.md`).

    1. Each cut across the trunk line (`trunk_cuts()`) gives the front and the two sides of the
       trunk at its height.
    2. The new front is the arc of an ellipse through the front at the two ends of `front`
       (`pinned_arc()`), and each new side an even curve through the side at the two ends of
       `sides` (`pinned_smooth()`). A side has a waist under the arm, so no ellipse arc fits it.
    3. Each vertex of the trunk surface (`TRUNK_PARTS`) between the ends moves: in the front
       half, its distance forward from the line takes the factor of the front at its height,
       and on each side, its distance from the middle plane takes the factor of its side. So
       each cut grows or shrinks as a whole, the facets keep their relief, and the back half
       keeps its depth. The side walls take no side move, so they stay in the plane of the seam.
    4. Each vertex of the belly front moves the share `round.share` of the way to the half
       ellipse through the front and the two sides of its cut, so that the ridge rounds out. The
       share fades out toward the sides (`round.fade`, in shares of the half width), and over
       0.05 at each end of `front`.
    5. With `flat`, each vertex of the front half of the trunk between the shares `flat.f` moves
       toward the trunk line in its cut, by `flat.move` units times a sine squared over `flat.f`
       and over the angle from the front (`flat.angle`, degrees). A range that holds the middle
       line moves the whole front of the upper belly, most at the middle, so the cut gets
       flatter with no crease beside the middle strip, where the bow upper arm lies in the
       play. The sides keep their places, so the front view keeps the oval.

    The ends keep their places, so the trunk joins the chest and the thighs with no step. The
    custom normals of the moved vertices stay: the rig reads no normal of the source.

    The fill of `step_wall()` is a flat plate on the plane of the seam: a fan of long thin faces
    with no vertex inside. The Bisect of the seam also left lips at its lower run: small trunk
    faces that turn back under the plate. In the play, the raised arm showed the plate as a light
    patch and the lips as a crease at its lower tip (user, 2026-10-27: "the cat's arm has
    lumps"). This step makes the wall again:

    1. The lips go (Delete Faces): from the lower run, each trunk face whose normal makes a dot
       product of at most `lip` with the normal of the plane, and that lies within `depth` units
       of the plane and at most `over` units over the armpit line, with its neighbors of the same
       kind. A vertex of the outline more than 0.002 units over the armpit line merges into the
       nearer of its neighbors on the outline (Merge at Last). At the front of the left arm, such
       a vertex rose 2 cm over the line: the outline crossed itself, and the fill left a hole of
       6 edges, or folded a face over a quad of the trunk.
    2. Fill: a 2D Delaunay triangulation (`delaunay_2d_cdt()` of Blender) of the outline of the
       hole, projected on the plane, and of the points of a grid of the side `grid` units inside
       it. The new vertices lie on the plane, and in the plane, a point of the outline over the
       armpit line takes the height of the line. The step stops when the fill adds or merges a
       point of the outline.
    3. Smooth Vertices along the normal of the plane only, `rounds` times with the factor 0.5:
       the new wall, its outline, and `rings` rings of trunk vertices below the armpit line
       move, and the armpit line stays. A vertex of the wall goes at most `deep` units into the
       trunk: the wall sinks where the lips were, but stays over the flat inner side of the arm.
       A move along the plane would drag the vertices across the wall.

    The replays of the other animals that take the steps of this script have no `wall`, and
    this step leaves their meshes as they are. Gives for each side the counts of the lips, of the
    merged vertices, of the new faces, and of the moving vertices, and the largest move in
    units.
