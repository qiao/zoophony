"""Replays the Blender session that rebuilds the arms of the bear conductor.

The long thin faces of the arms of `bear-tpose.glb` fold into dark shards under the raised
forearm, and the inner elbow of the bind collapses into a hollow. The rebuild uses loop edges,
retopology, and extra bones to fix the arm and wrist twist. This script repeats the steps of
`wind_arms.py` with the settings of the bear (`BEAR`):

1. Import the mesh and Merge by Distance.
2. Replace the faces of each arm from the shoulder line to the wrist with a quad tube, wrap it onto
   the source arm, bridge it to the trunk and to the paw, beautify the bridge triangles, and
   collapse the thin faces at the cut loops.
3. Give the new arm faces a UV layout, and bake the fur color of the source arm. Then make the
   inner side of each upper arm a little flatter (`step_flatten()` of `elephant_arms.py`),
   because the thick upper arm goes into the round belly when it comes down. Then transfer the
   custom normals of the source surface.
4. Keep the length and the cross-section of the arms (`factor` 1, `slim` 1), put the arm image in
   a strip of the atlas, and write `bear-arms.glb`.
5. Add the studio skeleton with the arm segments and the helpers, parent with automatic weights,
   and paint the fixes with the Weight Paint tools.
6. Write the weights for `paintedWeights` of the config (`bear-weights.json`).

The faces of the paws, the trunk, the legs, and the head stay the faces of the source mesh. The
source file, `bear-tpose.glb`, stays unchanged.

Run it in a terminal from the root of the tree:

    Blender -b --factory-startup -P tools/blender/bear_arms.py -- [<out dir>]

In the live Blender of MCP, `run_steps()` runs one step at a time.
