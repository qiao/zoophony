 * the display into another encoder of it. It also counts a command buffer whose surfaces all have
 * the size of the drawing buffer, such as a buffer with no surface. It drops each other command
 * buffer as work of the compositor, which reads the tiles of the page and writes the surface of
 * the window.
 *
 * A WebGL frame starts at the command buffer with the clear. It holds each counted command buffer
 * until the next start. Each frame writes a canvas surface in two command buffers: the clear, then
 * the final pass. Sometimes the trace gives no label to the clear. Thus a frame also starts at a
 * command buffer that writes the canvas when the frame already holds its final pass.

 * - Some clears have no label: 0.5% to 2% of the first command buffers have no encoder with the
 *   label `(Clear)`.
 * - A WebGL command buffer can hold surfaces of the display, such as a blit that writes a surface
 *   of 3456 × 2168 beside the read of the title backdrop.
 * - Some encoders have only the label `GPU Execution`, with no command buffer label.
 * - A canvas surface counts only when a clear with a label writes it. Chrome turns through about
 *   five canvas surfaces, so a short cut of a trace needs a clear with a label for each one.
 *
