/**
 * Checks the arms of the studio body of each role against one table of limits ({@link ARM_LIMITS},
 * design 4.4), so that a change of a hold, a rig, a pose, an instrument size, or a seat that twists
 * or deforms an arm stops before its merge. Five rounds each met their own measure and moved the
 * fault to a joint that no measure read (`docs/decisions/2026-10-19-arm-gate.md`). So the gate
 * reads the measures of `pnpm fold-probe`, `pnpm arm-shape`, and `pnpm hold-fit` together, for
 * each arm, over the rest, play, and lift samples of `probeFolds()` of `tools/fold-probe.ts`:
 *
 * - `folds`: the folded faces of the arm ({@link armFaces}), as `pnpm fold-probe` finds them. The
 *   value is the 95th percentile of the count.
 * - `twist`: the largest roll step of the skin from the chest along the upper arm, over the rings
 *   of {@link ARM_RINGS}, as `measureArm()` of `tools/arm-shape.ts` gives it. `forearm twist`: the
 *   same step from the elbow ring to the wrist ring, which a turn of the paw makes larger.
 * - `flat`: the narrow axis of the flattest ring as a share of its bind value. The value is the 5th
 *   percentile.
 * - `paw twist` and `paw swing`: the turn of the paw on its forearm from the bind pose, split into
 *   the twist around the forearm and the swing, as `pawAngles()` of `tools/hold-fit.ts` gives them
 *   for the mean turn.
 * - `paw jumps`: the share of the play and lift samples whose paw twist changes by more than
 *   {@link JUMP_ANGLE} from the sample before, as the flips of the bow paw of the hippo did.
 * - `stretch`: the largest growth of an edge of the faces of the forearm and the paw from the rest
 *   sample of the same body and demo, as a share of the length of the upper arm, such as a spike
 *   from the paw to the upper arm. A face that is long in the rest too does not count.
 * - `grip turn`: the turn of the paw twist in the play from the accepted grip of its arm
 *   ({@link ACCEPTED_GRIPS}). The value is the median, so a paw that holds its prop in another
 *   grip fails with no base. For a role with no entry, the tool prints a ready entry under the
 *   table ({@link gripLines}), and the role has no value `grip`.
 *
 * - `move twist` and `move turn`: the largest paw twist on the forearm, and the largest turn rate of
 *   the wrist in degrees per second, over the lifts and the lowerings of {@link probeMoves} at
 *   steps of 0.01 s (the set `move`). A paw twist past 180° makes the twist bone of the forearm
 *   jump by 180° in one step, and a mix of two turns near 180° apart jumps to the other side
 *   (`docs/research/2026-10-21-wrist-lift.md`).
 *
 * The other values are the 95th percentiles of the samples. Each value has a p50, a p95 (a p5 for
 * the flat share), and its worst sample (the demo and the time) in each sample set. The value of
 * the gate comes from the worst sample set.
 *
 * With `--base <ref>`, the commit runs beside the working tree, each role in a child process
 * (`probeBeside()` of `tools/ref-tree.ts`), with the gate of the working tree in place of its own
 * ({@link GATE_SCRIPTS}), so that both trees have the same measures. The JSON of the commit goes
 * into the cache by tree.
 * Each value then has a verdict ({@link verdictOf}): `FAIL` when it is over its limit and the base
 * is not, or when it is worse than the base by more than its margin; `OPEN` when it is over its
 * limit and not worse than the base (a known open item); else `PASS`. With no `--base`, each value
 * over its limit fails. A role that the commit does not have has no base. The
 * exit code is 1 when a value fails.
 *
 * The JSON of each role of the working tree goes into a cache by tree ({@link armCacheFile}), so a
 * second run on the same tree, such as the merge gate after the gate of the branch, reads it and
 * prints `tree: cached`. A change of a file of `src/`, `tools/`, or the demos gives a new key.
 *
 * The tool imports only the modules and the exports that the trees since 2026-10-18 have, because
 * a probe of an old commit copies it into the tree of the commit (`withProbeTree()`). A tree before
 * the label of the fold visit gets the labels of its samples from the plan of the demo.
 *
 * `--views <dir>` renders the worst play sample of each arm that fails, or of each arm with
 * `--views-all`, a strike, and a rest of the player, with `pnpm close-views play --at <species>`,
 * and writes one image of each frame: a 2x crop of each arm in each view, the commit on the left
 * and the working tree on the right (`tools/arm-views.ts`).
 *
 * `--trace <demo>:<from>-<to>` prints the paws of one role at each step of a range of song times,
 * or of wall times of the lift with `lift<from>-<to>`, with no sweep ({@link traceLines}). The
 * step is {@link TRACE_STEP} with no `--step`. A trace of 0.4 s takes about 1 s.
 *
 * `--states <ref>,...` runs the gate of the working tree on the code of each commit, in the probe
 * tree of the commit with this script in place of its own ({@link measureStates}), and prints one
 * table with a column for each commit and one for the working tree ({@link stateLines}). The exit
 * code reads the working tree, as the gate with no base.
 *
 * `--explain <measure>` explains `stretch` or `flat` of one role in this tree, with no child and
 * no cache ({@link explainLines}): the value of each arm in each sample set against the rest
 * sample and against the bind, with the mark `MOVES` at a stretch that is larger from the rest
 * than from the bind, the part of the rest sample of each demo that shrinks most from the bind,
 * and the worst edges or rings of the worst sample of each arm, with the bone of each.
 *
 * `--variant <name>` starts a variant of the holds, and each `--set` after it adds its changes to
 * the variant. Several `--variant` groups give several variants in one run ({@link checkVariants}).
 * Each variant of each role runs as one child, as a run with its `--set` options alone, with its
 * own cache by tree, and at most `--jobs` children run at the same time. One table gives a block
 * of rows for each variant. A variant with no `--set` is the working tree with no change. The
 * scene of one variant takes almost all the time of a child, and a change of a hold can change
 * the scene, so each child builds its own scenes.
 *
 * Usage: pnpm arm-check <role>... | --all [--base <ref>] [--set <changes>]...
 * [--variant <name> [--set <changes>]...]... [--glb <file>] [--views <dir> [--views-all]]
 * [--demo <id>]... [--midi <path>]... [--step <seconds>] [--jobs <n>] [--long], or
 * pnpm arm-check <role> --trace <demo>:[lift]<from>-<to> [--midi <path>] [--step <seconds>]
 * [--set <changes>]..., or pnpm arm-check <role> --explain <stretch | flat> [--demo <id>]...
 * [--midi <path>]... [--step <seconds>] [--set <changes>]...
 *
 * Each `--midi <path>` adds a MIDI file of the user to the demos as one more `--demo`
 * ({@link userFiles}), also on the commit of `--base` and `--states`.
