/**
 * Measures the contact of each paw of a woodwind player with its instrument over the sample sets
 * of the sweep of its role (design 5.3): the play, the lift, the rest, and the lowering. A gate of
 * the arms or of the depths can pass while the paws float beside the tube
 * (`docs/research/2026-10-24-wind-grips.md`), so this tool measures the grip itself, on the skin
 * of the studio as the GPU poses it.
 *
 * For each paw and each sample, it measures:
 *
 * - `gap`: the smallest distance from the skin of the paw (the bones `hand` and `fingers`) to the
 *   instrument, in cm. 0 when they touch or cross.
 * - `axis`: the distance from the middle of the closed paw to the axis of the tube, in cm.
 * - `in`: the depth of the axis of the tube in the closed paw, in cm. Above 0, the tube goes
 *   through the paw, as a stick goes through a fist.
 * - `tips`: the distance from the finger tips (the corners of the paw farthest from the wrist) to
 *   the instrument, in cm.
 * - `drift`: the distance from the middle of the closed paw to the palm point of the hand of the
 *   player, which the IK puts on the grip, in cm. The retarget turns the paw of the studio
 *   (`PAW_TURN` of `models/studio-rig.ts`), so the paw can leave the grip.
 * - `along`: the place of the middle of the paw along the tube from the mouthpiece, in cm, beside
 *   the place of its grip.
 * - `side`: the direction from the axis to the middle of the paw, in the axes of the chest
 *   (right, up, forward), in cm.
 * - `palm`: the angle between the normal of the palm and the direction from the middle of the paw
 *   to the axis, square to the axis, in degrees. 0 when the palm faces the tube.
 * - `place`: the angle between the direction from the axis to the middle of the paw and the side
 *   of the tube that the technique of the role names for the paw ({@link RoleGrip.places}), both
 *   square to the axis, in degrees.
 * - `top`: the height of the highest corner of the paw above the mouthpiece, in the axes of the
 *   chest, in cm. A paw far above it covers the face in the front view.
 *
 * A paw holds ({@link holds}) as a fist, with the tube through the middle of the paw, or as a
 * wrap, with its skin and its finger tips on the instrument. A paw grasps ({@link grasps}) as a
 * person sees a hand that holds a tube: its finger tips are on the instrument, its palm faces the
 * tube, and it is on the side of the tube that the technique names. The tool skips the palm and
 * the place when the middle of the paw is within {@link CENTERED} of the axis, because the tube
 * then goes through the closed paw. The table gives, for each set and paw, the share of the
 * samples in which the paw holds and grasps, the median of each measure, and the worst sample. It
 * also gives the smallest gap between the two paws. A paw that leaves its grip on purpose at
 * rest, as the left paw of the tan fox, still gets its row.
 *
 * The tube of a paw is the tube that the instrument names for its palm (`InstrumentGrips.tubeL`),
 * such as the valve casings of a trumpet or the brace of a trombone slide, else the tube of the
 * woodwind from its mouthpiece. The percussionist holds the clip of the triangle in its left paw.
 *
 * Usage: pnpm wind-grip <role>... [--demo <id>]... [--every <n>] [--set <changes>] [--lines]
 *
 * `--every <n>` takes each n-th play sample (8 by default), `--set` changes the holds in memory
 * (`tools/hold-sets.ts`), and `--lines` prints each sample. With several `--set` options, the tool
 * prints a scan: one row for the working tree and one row for each variant (about 3 s each).
