# Usage: tools/merge-branch.sh [--check-only] [--no-arm-check] <branch> [worktree]
#
# Rebases <branch> onto main, checks each commit, and fast-forwards main to it.
# <worktree> is the worktree that holds <branch>. With no <worktree>, the script
# adds a temporary worktree. The script stops at the first failure and keeps the
# branch and the worktree. It removes them only after a successful merge.
#
# tools/check-commits.sh, from the folder of this script, checks each commit. It
# keeps each passed result in a cache by tree, so a commit that an agent checked
# before prints "hit" and runs no check. MERGE_NO_CACHE=1 runs each check again.
# The full unit suite on the last commit always runs, with no cache, as a second
# guard against a wrong entry.
#
# --check-only runs each check and stops before the merge. The script rebases the
# branch onto main, but it does not change main, and it keeps the branch and the
# worktree.
#
# A branch that changes a file of src/pose/, src/models/, or tools/blender/ can twist
# or deform an arm, so after the unit suite the script runs the arm gate
# `pnpm arm-check --all --base main` (docs/agents/rigging.md, "The arm gate"), prints
# its table, and stops on a value that fails. The gate takes about 3 minutes with the
# base in the cache, so it runs all roles. --no-arm-check skips the gate. Use it only
# for a change that moves no arm, such as a color or a face, and give the reason in
# the merge report.
#
# The end-to-end tests are paused with all tests (design 9.3), so the script does
# not run them. MERGE_E2E=1 runs them.
#
# The end-to-end tests fail on a busy machine (a load average above about 30),
# and main fails in the same way. Before each run of these tests, the script waits
# until the 1-minute load average is at most MERGE_E2E_MAX_LOAD (default 20) and
# the test port (ZOOPHONY_E2E_PORT, default 4182) is free, for MERGE_E2E_WAIT
# seconds at most (default 900). It prints the cause of each wait. After a failure,
# the tests run one more time. A second failure stops the script. MERGE_E2E_CMD
# replaces the test command (for a test of this script).
#
# Exit codes: 1 bad use or bad state, 2 rebase conflict, 3 a commit or the full
# unit suite failed a check, 4 the commit hashes changed, 5 build or size failed,
# 6 the Chromium end-to-end tests failed two times, 7 a value of the arm gate failed,
# 8 main moved during the checks.
