/**
 * Counts the folded faces of the skin of the studio body of a role (design 4.4). It poses the
 * body as the app does, over each demo of the role. The test of a fold is the test of the
 * studio. The bind normal of a face moves by the mean of the skin matrices of its corners. The
 * face is folded when its posed normal is more than 90° from that normal. For each sample set,
 * the tool prints the samples, the samples with a fold, their share, and the most folded faces.
 * Then it prints the main bone of the folded faces. With `--faces <n>`, it also prints the `n`
 * faces that fold in the most samples, with their places, their corner angles, and the mark `ALL`
 * of a face that folds in each sample. For the body of a mesh rig, the table also gives the middle
 * of each face in the units of the source, ready for `weights.rigid` of the config
 * ({@link sourceMiddles}). A table of their corners in the worst fold of each face
 * follows: the places in the bind pose and in the posed skin, the moves of the corrective shapes,
 * and the weights. With `--json <file>`, it also writes the counts of each sample set into the
 * file for `pnpm rig-mesh --check`, and `--middles <faces>` adds the middle of each named face to
 * the file, so that `--watch` of the check pairs the faces of a rig with other corners. With
 * `--turns <face>`, it also prints the mean turn of the
 * upper arm of the side of the face in the axes of the chest in the samples in which the face
 * folds, and the share of the samples with a fold by the angle from that turn. Each `--set` changes
 * the holds in memory, as `pnpm pose-depth --set` does, so that `pnpm rig-mesh --check --hold`
 * fits a corrective shape to a hold with no commit. With `--base <ref> --faces-of <faces>`, the
 * faces of the commit pair with the folded faces of the working tree by their middles
 * ({@link pairBaseFaces}).
 *
 * `--bins <face>` gives the turn of each bone of the arm of the face from its bind pose with a fold
 * and with no fold, and the share of the samples with a fold by that turn ({@link binProbe}).
 *
 * Usage: pnpm fold-probe <role> [--demo <id>]... [--step <seconds>] [--faces <n>] [--turns <face>]
 * [--bins <face>] [--set <changes>]... [--json <file> [--middles <faces>]] [--glb <file>]
 * [--base <ref> [--faces-of <faces>]]
