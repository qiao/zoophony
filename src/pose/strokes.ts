 * Builds the bow strokes of one bowed string player (design 5.3). Notes that start together

 * its string, its position, and its finger: the hand keeps its position, and the fingers play
 * the notes. The bow changes direction on each bow: a note, or a slur of short notes in one beat
 * ({@link slurSizes}). A phrase starts with a down-bow at the frog. The length of a bow comes
 * from its length in time, and a little from the gesture size, and a fast bow moves toward the
 * balance point ({@link balanceShift}). A stroke of a measured tremolo moves the bow only a short
 * way ({@link measuredTremolo}). In a fast run across two strings, the right elbow keeps the mean
 * string ({@link crossStrings}). Pizzicato strokes keep the bow where it is. A tremolo
 * stroke makes short fast strokes around the place of the bow. A stopped bowed note of at least
 * `LEFT_HAND.vibrato.minSec` gets vibrato.
 *
 * @param notes The notes of the player, sorted by start.
 * @param loudness The loudness of each note, in the order of `notes` (design 5.3).
 * @param range The part of the bow hair that the player uses, in meters from the frog end of the
 *   hair. A small player cannot reach the tip of a long bow.
 * @param amplitude The seeded amplitude of the player, near 1.
 * @param instrument The bowed string of the player.
 * @param vibratoHz The rate of the vibrato of the player, from {@link vibratoRate}.
 * @param beats The times of the conducted beats, sorted. The slur rule reads them.
