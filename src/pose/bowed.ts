 * position on the fingerboard, and the hand moves only in a shift and in the vibrato. The block
 * turns toward the finger of the note and rolls to its string, the hand tilts further over the

 * the bow on the right thigh.
 *
 * The right elbow points to the directions of the hold, so that the arms stay out of the body.
 * The right hand rolls around the stick so that the back of the hand points to the elbow. In the
