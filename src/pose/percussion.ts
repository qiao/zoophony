/**
 * Writes the arms and the fingers of a percussion player (design 5.3, 4.7). Each mallet head goes
 * to the place of its strike state, and the two-bone IK places each arm. The cymbals keep
 * one turn from the bind pose (`PERCUSSION_PLACES.plateTurn`), and their inner faces meet at the crash point at the note start. In the
 * rest pose, the arms hang a little out to the sides, clear of the body (design 5.2).
 *
 * @param rig The points of the player.
 * @param frames The posed frames of the root and of the chest.
 * @param state The motion of the hands at the song time of the note layer.
 * @param weight The eased weight of the playing pose: 0 is the rest pose (5.2, 5.5).
 * @param rotations The rotations of the pose to write.
