 * equal intervals, the one nearer to the middle of the chord splits it. A chord within one octave
 * goes to the hand that is nearer to it, so that a melody stays in one hand. At the same
 * distance, it goes to the right hand from middle C up, and to the left hand below. A chord above
 * the reach of the left hand goes to the right hand, and a chord below the reach of the right
 * hand goes to the left hand, so that a melody changes hands where one hand cannot cross over the
 * other. These two rules also give a wide chord to one hand when all its keys are past the reach
 * of the other hand.
 *
 * With a distance `apart`, the middles of the keys of the two hands stay at least that far apart,
 * because two wide paws on near keys go into each other. When the middles of the two parts of a
 * chord wider than one octave are nearer, each hand plays half of the difference away from its
 * keys (`HandNote.shift`), so that a bass and a melody stay in two hands. When a hand plays nearer
 * to the other hand, the other hand moves out of its way, away from it, at the start of the chord:
 * a note of loudness 0 on the key at that distance, with no sound.
 *
 * @param notes The notes of the player, sorted by start.
 * @param loudness The loudness of each note, in the order of `notes`.
 * @param reach The highest key of the left hand and the lowest key of the right hand. No limit by
