/**
 * The hold of the violin on the left shoulder, for the rabbit (design 4.6, 5.3), as a real
 * violinist holds it (violinonline.com, "How to hold the violin", and Simon Fischer, "Basics:
 * Holding the violin"): the tail end on the left collarbone against the left side of the neck,
 * under the jaw, the jaw on the violin, the violin about 38° to the left of the front, and the
 * scroll a little up, so that the strings are about level. The violin is 0.83 of the app violin,
 * so that the arms of the A-pose mesh stretch only a little (`violinScale`). The middle line of
 * the violin points 50° to the left of the front, near the 45° of a real player
 * (`docs/reference/string-technique.md`, section 1.10). The left shoulder bone turns 15.5° forward
 * in the play (`reachL`), so that the shoulder joint comes 2.9 cm forward, inside the forward move
 * of the shoulder of real violinists, and the left paw reaches the fingerboard from 0.01 of its
 * length (0.08 at 60° with no turn). At 45°, the bow paw at the frog goes 1.9 cm into the jaw
 * (1.2 cm at 50°). The violin sits 0.09 H below the tail end of the chin hold, and the head turns
 * 17° down while the rabbit plays (`headDrop`), so that the jaw lies on the chin rest, as a
 * violinist rests the jaw on it: 0.03 H lower and 12° down, the violin goes 2.6 cm into the chest
 * (1.8 cm at this place). The back stays straight. The bow lies nearly square across the strings.
 * The right arm has the shoulder turn of the chin hold. At the frog, the right elbow points out
 * and forward, and only a little down, (1.8, -0.3, -1), and the bow keeps 0.06 m of free hair at
 * each end. With the elbow (1.5, -1.5, -1), the broad side of the long upper arm faces the front
 * as a flat plank. With this elbow, the upper arm reads across the body. With the A-pose mesh, 9
 * faces of the right arm fold in the arm gate (limit 8) at the elbow (1.8, -0.7, -1) of the red
 * fox, and 7 at this elbow. The bow plays no hair within 0.11 m of the frog (`frogHair`): with the
 * violin turned to 50°, the frog brings the bow paw to the jaw, and with 0.09 m, the right forearm
 * goes 1.7 cm into the body (1.2 cm with 0.11 m). In pizzicato, the paw plucks over the end of the
 * fingerboard (`pluckPlace` 0), with the bow tip up and back: with the pluck of the chin hold, near
 * the bow, the right forearm goes 3.5 cm into the body. The right elbow points down at the tip
 * too: up, as in the chin hold, the skin of the studio rabbit folds at the right upper arm
 * (`pnpm fold-probe violinist`). The left elbow points down, forward, and a little out,
 * (-0.5, -1, -0.5), so that it comes toward the middle of the body under the violin, as the elbow
 * of a real player (section 1.10): the upper arm turns 46° from the vertical to the side (57° with
 * the pole (-1, -1.4, -0.3)). With the elbow further in, the left paw twists 174° on its forearm
 * (limit 170).
 *
 * The string planes of the rabbit are 10° apart, below the 17° of the chin hold. A larger turn
 * folds the skin of the right arm and puts the bow paw into the violin at the frog on the E string:
 * the play folds in 2.5% of the samples at 10°, 3.9% at 11°, and 11.1% at 17°, and the paw goes
 * 1.7 cm into the violin at 10° and 2.0 cm at 11°.
 *
 * The rest pose and the lift follow the poses and the motion of the red fox: the violin stands
 * upright on the top of the left knee, at the knee joint, 0.1 H out and 0.1 H up, with the top
 * plate to the front. At 0.05 H down, the lower end sinks into the knee, and the left leg looks
 * cut from the left side. On the belly at 0.85 of the way, the scroll comes up to the chin, the
 * paw holds the neck at the mouth, and the violin goes 4.8 cm into the belly. The left paw holds
 * the neck at 0.4 of the fingerboard from the nut (`restPlace`), so that the paw closes around it:
 * at 0.1, the paw lies over the scroll and does not hold the violin. The left elbow points down, a
 * little out, and a little back, (-0.6, -1, 0.3).
 *
 * In the lift and the lowering, the violin hangs from the left paw, and the paw turns with it, so
 * that the violin turns in the same direction as the wrist and the arm (`carryLift()` of
 * `pose/bowed.ts`). The wrist moves on a line from its rest place to its playing place, and
 * 0.15 H out, 0.15 H up, and 0.15 H to the front in the middle (`liftReach`): with 0.35 H up and
 * 0.2 H to the front, the violin goes 2.8 cm into the body in a lowering, and with no move to the
 * front, the bow goes 3.6 cm into the body. At rest, the paw holds the neck in its rest grip
 * (`restHandAt()` of `pose/bowed.ts`): the playing grip at the rest place, with the fingers curled
 * 60° (`restCurlL`), 5 mm off the neck (`restGapL`), and turned -5° around the normal of the top
 * plate (`restYawL`), and the paw takes a turn of 20° in the plane of its palm (`restPawTurnL`),
 * near the turn of 34° of the play, so that the grip in the paw changes by 22° in a move (56° with
 * the turn of 30° around the normal), and the paw goes 0.2 cm into the violin. With no turn around
 * the normal, the wrist skin flattens in the lift (flat p5 0.70 against 0.76), and with a turn of
 * 25° in the plane of the palm, the violin goes 2.0 cm into the body in a lift (1.8 cm with 20°).
 * In the middle of the move, the elbow points out and a little down, as at rest (`liftPoleL`):
 * down and to the front, (0, -1, -0.5), the left upper arm goes 2.5 cm into the body in the lift.
 * The left rest elbow points down and a little out and back, (-0.6, -1, 0.3), so that the left arm
 * bends at the side: with the elbow out, (-1, -0.6, 0), the arm reaches up to the nut and looks
 * long and bent. In the middle of the move, the bow tip points forward and a little out and up,
 * (0.4, 0.3, -1), with the hair to the back, and the grip moves 0.3 H out, 0.1 H up, and 0.3 H to
 * the front: with the tip up, (0.2, 0.8, -0.6), the bow stands upright in front of the face, and
 * with the grip 0.2 H to the front only, the right elbow of the red fox goes 4.3 cm into the body
 * in a lowering. With the via of `UPRIGHT_BOW`, the right paw turns 5,188°/s in a lowering. With
 * 0.2 H to the front, the right forearm goes 2.2 cm into the body in a lowering. With no move up,
 * the right elbow opens to 163° (147° with this move). With 0.05 H out, the right paw twists 145°
 * on its forearm in a lowering. With 0.3 H to the front and the violin at the jaw, the right paw
 * twists 147° in a lowering.
 *
 * The right elbow hangs near the side, as the elbows of a seated violinist. The belly is widest
 * below the elbow, so the right arm hangs out around it, and the paw does not reach the top of the
 * right thigh. The grip rests at the front of the lap, 0.25 H out from the top of the knee, 0.7 H
 * above it, and 0.2 H to the front, and the elbow points down and back, (0.3, -1, 0.6), so that
 * the upper arm hangs 19° from the vertical with a straight wrist. Thus the bow arm and the wrist
 * are relaxed, and the bow paw rests low near the belly and the lap. With the grip 0.4 H out and
 * 0.85 H up, the paw stands 0.48 H out at the side. With a grip further in on the lap, the place
 * falls on the top of the belly. With the grip 0.5 H to the front, the arm reaches nearly straight
 * to the front and looks long. With the grip 0.65 H out and 0.45 H up, the arm hangs straight down
 * at the side. With the paw on the top of the thigh, the short right arm folds 13 to 22 faces at
 * rest. With the grip 0.55 H out and 0.45 H above the knee, face 372 of the right upper arm turns
 * over in each rest sample. With the grip on the belly over the right thigh, the paw is 25 cm from
 * the shoulder joint, so the bent arm puts the elbow 19 cm out from the side, the upper arm turns
 * 81° from the vertical, and 20 faces of the right arm turn over. Each grip nearer to the thigh
 * puts the forearm into the belly or turns more faces over.

/**
 * The hold of the violin on the left shoulder, for the red fox (design 4.6, 5.3): the hold of the
 * rabbit, with the tail end against the left side of the short neck of the fox, under its long
 * jaw. On the collarbone, 0.087 H further forward and 0.035 H lower, the violin keeps 2.4 cm from
 * the neck. The violin sits 0.07 H further back and 0.016 H further left, so that the left paw
 * reaches the nut. Straight back by 0.06 H, the violin goes 1.3 cm into the neck. It sits 0.01 H
 * higher, and goes 1.0 cm into the trunk and the neck. The head stays level (`headDrop` 0),
 * because the long jaw already lies on the violin. The short neck brings the head and the violin
 * 1.7 cm down, so the violin sits a further 0.01 H higher: 0.01 H lower, it goes 2.4 cm into the
 * body in the play. The middle line of the violin points 45° to the left of the front, as a real
 * player holds it (`docs/reference/string-technique.md`, section 1.10), and the left shoulder bone
 * turns 8° forward in the play (`reachL`), so that the long left arm of the fox reaches the nut
 * with 1.5 cm to spare. The left elbow keeps the pole of the chin hold: further in, under the
 * violin, the left paw turns 9° to 15° further from its accepted grip. The bow slants 12° and the
 * right shoulder turns 15°, and the right elbow at the tip points less down: with the bow of the
 * rabbit (5°, 30°), the skin of the right shoulder of the fox mesh folds in 18% of the play
 * samples (`pnpm fold-probe fox-violinist`), and with the full violin, the turn of 15° folds fewer
 * samples than 25°. At the frog, the right elbow points out, forward, and a little down,
 * (1.8, -0.7, -1), and the bow keeps 0.12 m of free hair at each end: with 0.08 m and the violin
 * further back, the bow paw goes 3.7 cm into the body at the frog, with 0.1 m and the elbow
 * (1.4, -0.7, -1) 3.0 cm, and with this hold 2.4 cm, with the same share of folded play samples.
 * The bow paw reaches 0.265 m of the hair, more than half. In pizzicato, the bow tip points up,
 * back, and a little out, (0.3, 0.5, 1): with the tip of the chin hold, (0.3, 1, 0.4), the bent
 * wrist of the plucking paw moves the middle of the paw 2.1 cm from the stick, and with this tip
 * 1.2 cm.
 *
 * The rest pose is the upright rest of the rabbit: the violin stands on the left thigh at 0.8 of
 * the way to the knee, 0.18 H down and 0.2 H forward. The thighs slope 25° down, so at 0.65 of the
 * way, 0.24 H down, and 0.3 H forward, the lower end stands 13.8 cm above the thigh. The left paw
 * holds the violin at 0.37 of the fingerboard (`restPlace`), so that it closes around the neck: at
 * 0.2, the paw lies over the scroll. The long right arm of the fox reaches the right thigh only
 * nearly straight, and its line from the shoulder to a paw on the top of the thigh passes through
 * the side of the belly: with the grip 0.15 H out at 0.65 of the way, the right upper arm goes
 * 6.2 cm into the body. The stick passes through the paw, so the hand sits about 4 cm further out
 * on the bow. The grip rests 0.25 H out at 0.75 of the way, 0.5 H up, and 0.25 H to the front, at
 * the front of the lap and near the body, and the right elbow points down, out, and back,
 * (0.5, -1, -0.2), so that the upper arm hangs 22° from the vertical with a straight wrist. Thus
 * the bow paw rests near the belly and the lap. With the elbow (0.4, -1, 0), the right upper arm
 * goes 3.0 cm into the body at rest, and with (0.4, -1, -0.3) and the grip 0.2 H out, the skin of
 * the right arm flattens (flat 0.73 against 0.78). The left rest elbow points down and a little
 * out and back, (-0.6, -1, 0.3), as on the rabbit: out, (-1, -0.6, 0), the arm looks long and
 * bent. The left paw holds the neck at rest in the rest grip of the rabbit, 5 mm toward the neck
 * (`restGapL`), with no turn around the normal of the top plate and a turn of 25° in the plane of
 * its palm (`restPawTurnL`), so that the grip in the paw changes by 27° in a move, and the paw
 * goes 0.5 cm into the violin. At 0.4 of the fingerboard with a turn of 35°, the forearm goes
 * 0.2 cm into the violin at rest. In the lift and the lowering, the violin hangs from the left
 * paw, as on the rabbit, and the wrist moves 0.1 H out and 0.15 H to the front in the middle
 * (`liftReach`), so that the violin near the jaw goes 1.9 cm into the body: with 0.1 H to the
 * front, it goes 2.1 cm in, and with 0.1 H up and 0.2 H to the front, 2.6 cm. The bow takes the
 * via of the rabbit: with the hair down, the right paw turns 17,038°/s in a lowering.
 *
 * The left elbow turns toward the body by 2° for each lower string of the finger: with the 5° of
 * the chin hold, the left forearm goes 2.4 cm into the violin in the middle of the lift and of the
 * lowering, and with 2°, 1.9 cm and 2.1 cm.
 *
 * The string planes of the red fox stay 9° apart, and the stick leans 15°. A larger turn or tilt
 * folds the skin of the right arm of the fox mesh: the play folds in 21.7% of the samples at 17°
 * and 30°, 7.0% at 9° and 30°, 6.1% at 9° and 15°, and 6.0% at 10° and no tilt.

 * The hold of the viola under the chin, for the cat mesh (design 4.6, 5.3). The arms of the cat
 * are 1.10 H long, and its jaw lies in front of its chest under the long muzzle, so the tail end
 * of the viola lies about 0.14 m in front of the left shoulder joint. Thus the cat plays a viola
 * of about 10 inches, 0.74 of the viola of the app (`SpeciesParams.violaScale`), as a violin shop
 * sizes a viola for the arm less the muzzle, and holds it nearer to the body than the viola hold
 * of {@link BOWED_HOLDS}: 0.05 H further right, 0.14 H higher, and 0.23 H further back
 * (`playShift`), turned 10° further to the left than 45°, near the angle of a real player
 * (`docs/reference/string-technique.md`, section 1.10), and tilted 11° forward, so that it falls
 * 10° to the scroll (`playTurn`). The left paw then reaches the fingerboard from the nut to its
 * end, and the bow paw the hair from the frog to the end of the free hair at the tip
 * (`pnpm hold-reach cat --instrument viola`). The head lifts 15° in the play (`headDrop` below
 * 0), so that the jaw lies on the chin rest of the higher viola: with the head level, the jaw goes
 * 2.0 cm into the viola. The left shoulder bone turns 20° forward in the play (`reachL`), near the
 * forward move of the shoulder of real violinists: with 35° and the viola tilted 5°, the back of
 * the left arm root sinks into pits of 14.5 cm³ in the play (4.8 cm³ with this hold), and with 20°
 * and that tilt, the paw reaches the fingerboard only from 0.03. With the 1/2 viola (0.87) at the
 * place for longer arms, the arm reaches the fingerboard from 0.69, and the bow 0.26 m of 0.44 m.
 * With the viola 4 cm back, the bow reaches the tip, but the viola goes 2.7 cm into the jaw and
 * the chest (1.2 cm with this hold, limit 2.0). The bow lies square across the strings (`slant`
 * 0), as a real bow: with the slant of -20° of the viola hold, the right paw swings 76° on the
 * wrist in the lift (limit 70).
 *
 * The deep chest of the cat takes the room of the left elbow: with the left elbow pole of the
 * chin hold, the left upper arm goes 5.5 cm into the body in the play. The left elbow points down
 * and forward, and a little less out, so that it comes toward the middle under the viola: the
 * upper arm turns 38° from the vertical to the side. With the elbow (-0.5, -1, -0.75), the left
 * upper arm goes 2.4 cm into the body in the play (1.2 cm with this elbow). The stick of the bow
 * passes through the middle of the paw (`SpeciesParams.bowGrip`), and the hand sits about 4 cm
 * further out on the bow, so the right elbow of the play points a little further out than the
 * elbow of the chin hold. The right elbow of the play points out to the side, a little down, and
 * forward, (2, -0.3, -0.7), so that it comes near the height of the hand, as the elbow of a real
 * violist at the frog, and the arm does not bend in an unnatural way. With the elbow level,
 * (2, 0, -0.5), the paw twist of the bow arm passes the margin of the arm gate. With
 * (1.2, -0.5, -1), the upper arm hangs down the side of the body, and the forearm folds up to the
 * chin. With (1.1, -1, -1), the back of the upper arm goes 3.8 cm into the body. At the tip, the
 * right elbow points down, out, and forward, (1.5, -1, -1), further out than the elbow of the
 * rabbit, because the shorter arm reaches the tip nearly straight across the round belly: with
 * (1, -1, -1), the right upper arm goes 2.7 cm into the belly at the tip (2.1 cm with this elbow).
 * With the elbow up of the chin hold, (0.5, 1, -1), a dark wedge fold opens under the right armpit
 * at the tip, the right paw turns 116° on its forearm (90° with this elbow), and the narrowest ring
 * of the right arm keeps 0.14 of its axis (0.49 with this elbow). The right shoulder bone turns 36°
 * forward (`reach`, 30° in the viola hold), so that the nearly straight bow arm passes in front of
 * the even oval belly: with 30°, the right upper arm goes 2.9 cm into the belly in the play, and
 * with 40°, new faces at the back of the right shoulder fold in each play sample. The front of the
 * upper belly is a little flatter, most at the middle line, where the upper arm lies (`flat` of
 * `tools/blender/cat_arms.py`). In pizzicato, the right elbow points out, a little down, and
 * forward, (1.2, -0.5, -1), a little further out than the chin hold, and the right palm plucks
 * 0.1 m from the strings toward the frog side (`pluckSide`), as the hand of a real player comes up
 * from the side: with the palm over the strings, the middle of the upper arm goes 2.1 cm into the
 * top of the chest under the chin in a pizzicato and in the lowering after it (1.3 cm in the
 * lowering with this side). With 0.05 m, it goes 1.9 cm in, and with the elbow (1.3, -0.35, -1)
 * or (1.5, -0.5, -1), the move twist of the arm gate passes its margin.
 *
 * The rest pose is the upright rest of the rabbit and the red fox, as a seated violinist rests:
 * the viola stands upright on the top of the left thigh, 0.6 of the way from the hip to the knee,
 * and 0.12 H in from it, 0.05 H up, and 0.06 H to the front, in the reach of the short arms, and
 * the bow rests in the right paw at the front of the lap. The left paw holds the viola at 0.55 of
 * the fingerboard from the nut (`restPlace`), and the left elbow points down, out, and a little
 * forward, (-1.6, -1, -0.2), so that the left elbow bends near the side of the round belly, as a
 * seated violist holds the resting instrument with the elbow bent. With the viola 0.8 of the way
 * and the elbow (-1.2, -1, 0.1), the left upper arm goes 2.3 cm into the belly at rest, and its
 * middle goes flat. With 0.95 of the way and 0.03 H back, on the front of the knee, the elbow
 * opens to 131°, and the arm reaches far forward and looks long. With the viola 0.03 H back at
 * 0.8 of the way, the elbow bends to 105°, but the viola goes 2.1 cm into the body near the end of
 * a lowering. With the viola 0.1 H up and 0.1 H forward and the grip at 0.4, the left arm reaches
 * out nearly straight, and with the elbow further down, the left upper arm goes 2.2 cm to 3.7 cm
 * into the belly (limit 1.5). With 0.2 H in, the viola goes 2.6 cm into the body. The left paw
 * closes around the neck in the rest grip, as a seated violist holds the neck with the left hand
 * (`docs/reference/string-technique.md`, section 2.9): the playing grip at the rest place, curled
 * 115°, with the palm on the neck (`restGapL` 0), and turned 10° around the normal of the top
 * plate, and the paw takes a turn of 42° in the plane of its palm (`restPawTurnL`), so that the
 * grip in the paw changes by 29° in a move. The neck then runs through the closed paw, and the
 * paw goes 0.4 cm into the viola. Curled 90° and 11 mm off the neck, the paw closes beside the
 * neck as a fist and does not hold the viola. With a turn of 12° around the normal, the wrist skin
 * flattens in the lift (flat p5 0.70 against 0.75).
 *
 * The grip of the bow rests at the front of the lap, 0.4 H out, 0.6 H up, and 0.05 H to the front
 * at 0.6 of the way to the knee, with the tip a little forward, (0.15, 1, -0.45): 0.4 H up, the
 * shorter right forearm goes 1.2 cm into the belly at rest. The right elbow hangs down, out, and a
 * little back, (0.9, -1, 0.2): the elbow bends near the side of the round belly with a straight
 * wrist, and the paw rests low near the hip. With (0.8, -1, 0.3), the right upper arm goes 1.4 cm
 * into the belly at rest (0.8 cm with this elbow), and with (0.7, -1, 0.3), 1.7 cm. With the paw
 * high at the chest, the elbow bends to 76° as a wing. The round belly keeps the upper arm 35°
 * from the vertical: with the elbow further down and in, (0.3, -1, 0.1), the right upper arm goes
 * 4.1 cm and the forearm 3.1 cm into the belly. A place of the lap between 0.5 and 0.6 of the way
 * lies on the top of the belly. The arm of the cat, with the reach of the red fox, reaches the top
 * of the thigh only nearly straight: a grip at 0.7 of the way puts the elbow at 180°. A level bow
 * runs forward past the knees, and a real violist rests as a violinist.
 *
 * In the lift and the lowering, the viola hangs from the left paw, and the paw turns with it, as
 * on the rabbit (`carryLift()` of `pose/bowed.ts`). The wrist moves 0.14 H out, 0.29 H up, and
 * 0.19 H to the front in the middle (`liftReach`), so that the viola near the jaw goes at most
 * 2.0 cm into the body in a lowering: with 0.25 H up and 0.2 H to the front, it goes 2.1 cm in.
 * With 0.2 H to the front, the right claws go deeper into the viola, and with 0.23 H, 2.4 cm. In
 * the middle of the moves, the left elbow points out and a little down, as at rest (`liftPoleL`).
 * With (-0.45, -1, -0.6), the left upper arm goes 1.7 cm into the body in the lift. In the middle,
 * the bow points forward and a little out and up, (0.4, 0.3, -1), and the grip moves 0.5 H out,
 * 0.45 H up, and 0.15 H to the front, so that the bow arm passes outside the round belly and the
 * viola. With 0.45 H out, 0.35 H up, and 0.1 H to the front, the right claws go 2.1 cm into the
 * carried viola at the start of a lowering, and with 0.45 H out, 0.5 H up, and 0.2 H to the
 * front, the right upper arm goes flat in the lift. With 0.05 H to the front, the bow goes 0.7 cm
 * into the viola in a lowering of `beethoven-9`. With 0.3 H out and 0.15 H to the front, the right
 * upper arm goes 7.2 cm into the belly in a lowering of `brahms-2`, and with 0.4 H to the front,
 * the arm goes straight (180°). With the tip up, (0, 1, -0.6), the bow stands upright in front of
 * the face. With the via of `UPRIGHT_BOW` (the tip forward, the grip 0.3 H out and 0.1 H up), the
 * bow lies across the belly and goes 1.3 cm into the viola and 2.7 cm into the arms. With a move
 * of 0.4 H up, the left paw rises to the top of the head.
 *
 * A cat soloist who stands hangs the bow from the right paw with the tip down, a little forward and
 * out, and turns it through the front in the lift and the lowering (`HANGING_BOW`).
 *
 * The string planes of the cat are 7° apart, below the 17° of the chin hold: with the shorter arm
 * and the stick leaned 30°, the bow arm reaches the end of the hair with 7°, and only to 2 cm
 * short of the end with 11°.
 *
 * The left elbow turns toward the body by 2° for each lower string of the finger: with the 5° of
 * the chin hold, the left upper arm goes 1.5 cm into the deep chest in the play, and with 2°,
 * 0.0 cm.
 *
 * From the second position to the fifth position, the left paw tilts 20° further over the neck, so
 * that the wrist comes up toward the upper bout (`highTilt`, `leftTilt()` of `pose/bowed.ts`). The
 * viola sits back toward the neck, so the left forearm runs from the wrist back under the viola,
 * and with no tilt it goes 2.7 cm into the upper bout near the wrist in the fifth position at the
 * end of `mozart-k191`, also while the arms lower. A turn of the left elbow does not change it,
 * because the forearm leaves the wrist toward the shoulder. With 45°, the forearm goes 0.4 cm into
 * the viola, but the paw lies flat across the fingerboard, and the wrist bends 75°: a broken wrist.
 * With 20°, the fingers still point down to the strings, and the wrist bends 48°. The remaining
 * depth of the forearm at the upper bout is accepted.
 *
 * The left paw tilts 45° over the neck (`tiltL`, 30° in the chin hold), so that it curls around
 * the neck and the fingers come down on the strings from above, as a real violist holds the neck
 * (`docs/reference/string-technique.md`, section 1.9). With 30°, the paw turns 157° on its
 * forearm from the bind, and the skin of the wrist under the neck pinches into a twisted band of
 * thin faces: the wrist ring keeps 0.58 of its narrow axis in the bind. With 45°, the paw turns
 * 147°, the wrist ring keeps 0.66, the left forearm goes 1.5 cm into the viola in the play (2.5 cm
 * with 30°), and the wrist bends 30° from the line of the forearm (15° with 30°). With 40°, the
 * wrist keeps a crease, and with 50°, the wrist bends 34°. In the fifth position, the paw tilts 65°
 * with `highTilt`.
 *
 * In the rest pose, the top plate of the viola faces the front and 30° to the left, toward the
 * audience, as the bridge of a resting violin faces out (`docs/reference/string-technique.md`,
 * section 2.9). Thus the back of the viola does not face the audience.

/**
 * The hold of the cello between the knees, for the dog mesh (design 4.6, 5.3), as a real cellist
 * holds it (`docs/reference/string-technique.md`, section 2.7): the cello leans back 25° from the
 * vertical, with the back of the upper bout at the chest, the neck at the left of the head, and
 * the endpin on the floor 0.06 m right of the middle and 0.66 m in front of the floor point of the
 * seat. It leans 14° to the left, and its top plate turns 6° to the right. It keeps this place in
 * the rest pose (`BowedHold.rest` null). The short thighs end far behind the lower bout, so the
 * knees do not touch the cello.
 *
 * The left paw tilts 55° over the neck (`tiltL`), and the left elbow points out to the left and
 * nearly level, because the leaned neck comes near the left shoulder, and turns up 2° for each
 * lower string. The right shoulder turns 30°.
 *
 * The short arms reach the strings only nearly straight. The trunk leans 3° forward, so that the
 * shoulders come nearer to the strings, and the right elbow points out and down, near the body.
 * The bow plays no hair within 0.12 m of the frog (`frogHair`), and the string planes are 6°
 * apart, so that the paw at the frog and on the C string stays out of the right rim of the
 * cello. In pizzicato, the right paw comes up from the side, as a real player plucks with the hand
 * hanging from the wrist and the thumb near the edge of the fingerboard
 * (`docs/reference/string-technique.md`, section 2.8): it plucks 0.2 of the way from the end of the
 * fingerboard to the bow contact, 0.15 m right of the strings (`pluckSide`), with the elbow out and
 * down (`polePizzicato`). Over the fingerboard (`pluckPlace` -0.3), the paw lies flat across the
 * strings, the right upper arm turns 101° and goes 5.2 cm into the body, and the front of the
 * right shoulder folds in 87% of the pizzicato samples. With this pluck, the upper arm turns 79°
 * and goes 2.2 cm in, and 20% of the samples fold.
 *
 * In the rest pose, the right paw holds the bow over the right knee, 0.25 H out and 0.5 H above
 * the top of the thigh at 0.9 of the way to the knee, with the tip up and leaned out and forward,
 * away from the cello, and the right elbow points out, down, and back. The short arm then bends
 * softly at the elbow, and the wrist bends 22° with the palm toward the body. The left paw holds
 * the cello at 0.6 of the fingerboard with the elbow down and out, near the side. In the lift and
 * the lowering, the bow turns through the front, and the grip moves 0.3 H out, away from the
 * cello.

/**
 * The hold of the contrabass of the hippo mesh, which stands (design 4.6, 5.3). A real bassist
 * leans the contrabass on the body, and the contrabass does not go in
 * (`docs/reference/string-technique.md`, section 2.8). The round belly of the hippo reaches 0.35 m
 * in front of its shoulder joints, the back of its smaller contrabass (`bassScale`) lies 0.26 m
 * behind the strings, and its arms are only 0.51 m long. Thus the back of the contrabass touches
 * the front of the belly, and the arms reach the strings with the help of the shoulders. The end
 * pin of 0.2 m (`BASS_END_PIN`) stands on the floor 0.48 m right of the place of
 * `UPRIGHT_HOLDS` and 8 cm forward (`playShift`), and the contrabass turns around it
 * (`playTurn`): it leans 33° from the vertical, to the left and 6° back, and its top plate faces
 * forward. The strings run from the contact point 0.28 m in front of the belly up to the nut beside
 * the head. With a lean 5° further back and the contact point 11 cm further back, the back of the
 * contrabass goes 14.8 cm into the belly and the chest. The trunk leans 12° forward. The right
 * shoulder turns 50° forward, and the left shoulder 25° (`reachL`), also in the rest: with no left
 * turn, the left paw reaches one place of the fingerboard only, and the left forearm goes 3.7 cm
 * into the neck. With a right turn of 55°, the skin of the chest under the chin folds.
 *
 * The string planes are 6° apart, below the 25° of a real contrabass, as on the cello of the dog:
 * with 12°, the bow arm reaches 4 cm of the hair at this place, and the right arm goes 5.1 cm into
 * the contrabass. The bow plays no hair within 0.25 m of the frog (`frogHair`): the short bow arm
 * reaches the frog only straight, and then the right upper arm goes 5.2 cm into the right rim of
 * the upper bout. The right elbow points out, a little up, and forward, and less up at the tip, so
 * that the forearm slopes down to the bow and the wrist stays nearly straight, as on a real
 * bassist. With the elbow forward, out, and a little down, the forearm lies level across the
 * belly, the paw bends down onto the bow like a hook, the arm looks bent in an unnatural way, and
 * the right upper arm goes 4.1 cm into the body. With the elbow level at the tip and the grip in
 * the middle of the paw, it goes 3.0 cm into the body (2.8 cm with this elbow). With the elbow of
 * the frog at the tip, face 443 of the right forearm folds in 0.3% of the play. The left elbow
 * points out to the left, a little down, and forward. Both elbows are low, with the twist bone of
 * the upper arm: with the level elbow, the right upper arm rolls 86° on the median of the play,
 * and the shoulder skin twists into a flat band. With the left elbow up and back, the left upper
 * arm turns 80°. The left elbow turns up 2° for each lower string, as on the cello of the dog:
 * with 10°, the thick left upper arm goes 7.0 cm into the contrabass (6.4 cm with 2°). The left
 * paw tilts 55° over the neck, as the paw of the dog: with the 30° of the floor hold, the left arm
 * goes 6.9 cm into the body (5.6 cm with 55°).
 *
 * In pizzicato, the right paw comes up from the side, 0.18 m right of the strings (`pluckSide`),
 * as a real bassist rests the thumb on the edge of the fingerboard
 * (`docs/reference/string-technique.md`, section 2.8). The right shoulder lies 0.16 m behind the
 * back of the contrabass, so the arm reaches the strings nearly straight: with the palm above the
 * strings, the arm goes through the right rim of the upper bout, 7.7 cm deep. The elbow points out
 * to the right, up, and forward: with the elbow out and level, the forearm goes 1.7 cm into the
 * rim in 3% of the samples of `boulanger-matin`, and with the elbow of the bow, the paw twists
 * 153° in the lowering after a pizzicato (the arm gate). The bow tip points up, square to the
 * strings, so that the forearm comes to the hand at about 45° in the plane of the palm, as in the
 * play: with the tip up, left, and forward, it comes at 100° to 109°, past the limit of
 * `PAW_TURN` of `models/studio-rig.ts`, and the paw swings up to 41° off the forearm. With the tip
 * up, forward, and a little out and the elbow a little up, the straight paw twists 159° on its
 * forearm in the lowering after a pizzicato (140° with this tip, the arm gate).
 *
 * The left paw stops the strings only up to 0.7 of the fingerboard from the nut (`stopEnd`): the
 * left shoulder lies behind the upper bout, so a paw over the bout puts the thick left forearm
 * 7.0 cm into it, and with 0.73 already 2.4 cm. A real bassist raises the elbow so that the wrist
 * comes over the shoulder of the instrument, but the short arm of the hippo does not reach so far.
 *
 * The right elbow lies near the backward line of the stick, and on the E and the A strings it lies
 * near the far side of the stick for the roll of the hand. With the far side at 180°, a change of
 * the string turns the paw by about 200° (847 jumps above 90° in 0.25 s over the demos). The far
 * side lies at 30°, in the middle of the angles that no elbow of the play takes (-40° to 110°), so
 * the roll stays at one end of its range: 20 jumps, and the dog cellist has 25. On the low
 * strings, the paw then goes more than 1.5 cm into the belly in 4.6% of the play samples (0% with
 * 180°).
 *
 * In the rest pose, the contrabass stays at its playing place, and the left paw holds the neck
 * with the elbow out to the left and a little down: with the elbow further down, the left forearm
 * goes 2.2 cm into the neck in the lift and the lowering, and with a level elbow, the left paw
 * twists 178° on its forearm in the lowering (limit 176°). The right paw hangs beside the belly
 * with the bow tip down (`HANGING_BOW`), and the elbow points down and a little out, as the arms of
 * the mesh hang: at the knee of the floor hold, under the belly, the right forearm goes 13.8 cm
 * into the body. With the elbow further out, the arm segments roll the hanging upper arm so far
 * that the skin twists 41° along it (29° with this elbow, the arm gate). With the elbow further
 * in or forward, the right forearm goes 1.6 cm to 4.8 cm into the belly. The grip in the middle
 * of the paw holds the paw 2.5 cm nearer to the frog, so the rest grip lies 0.1 H further out:
 * 0.1 H further in, two faces of the inner right elbow fold in each rest sample, and with the grip
 * 0.1 H lower, the right upper arm goes 6.2 cm into the body at rest (5.7 cm at this place). In
 * the lift and the lowering, the tip turns through the front, as the upright bow of the
 * violinists, with the grip 0.3 H out, 0.3 H up, and 0.6 H to the front: with no move up, the bow
 * paw turns 2,959°/s at the most in the lowering.
 *
 * The bow paw keeps the bend of its bind pose on the forearm (`pawKeepR` 1), as a bassist holds
 * the French bow "as if the hand is resting by the side" (`docs/reference/string-technique.md`,
 * section 2.1). The bind bends the short paw 25° off the thick forearm, and the turn of the
 * retarget onto the line of the forearm bends the skin of the wrist 25° off that form: the edges
 * of the wrist stretch up to 1.9 times, and the heel of the paw shows as a lump under the bow paw
 * from the right. With the bend, they stretch up to 1.3 times.
 *
 * The bow hand turns in the plane of its palm around the grip on the stick, so that the forearm
 * keeps 45° in that plane (`stickTurnR`), and the paw keeps one turn on the hand. The grip lies in
 * the middle of the closed paw (`SpeciesParams.bowGrip`), so the stick stays within 0.4 cm of it
 * in the play, the lift, the rest, and the lowering. The bow turns in the paw over a stroke. With
 * the paw turned toward the forearm by the retarget alone, the forearm turns about 45° against the
 * bow over a stroke, and the paw slides up to 2.4 cm off the stick. The turn goes up to 90°,
 * because the lowering after a pizzicato turns the forearm up to 79° past 45°.
