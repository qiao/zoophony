 * away from the shoulder. In the rest pose, the palms rest in the lap.
 *
 * The caller writes the lean of the hold into the spine before it calculates the frames.
 *
 * @param rig The points of the player.
 * @param frames The posed frames of the root and of the chest.
 * @param state The motion of the hands at the song time of the note layer.
 * @param weight The eased weight of the playing pose: 0 is the rest pose (5.2, 5.5).
