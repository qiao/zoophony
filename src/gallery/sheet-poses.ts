 * - The violin of `fox-views.png` and `rabbit-views.png` lies on the left shoulder under the chin:
 *   it moves 0.25 H to the left and 0.05 H up from the stage hold, turns 25° from the left toward
 *   the front (45° to the left of the front), and tilts the scroll up 15°. The left hand holds
 *   the neck at the scroll, at the height of the mouth. The bow plays an A4 on the open A string
 *   in the middle of the hair, 1.4 s into the first down-bow of a phrase, so that the bow paw is
 *   at the chest, as in the sheets. The right elbow keeps the direction of the frog, forward and
 *   down, so that it hangs at the side. With the hold of the stage, the violin was in front of
 *   the chest, and the left hand 0.77 H below the head center. Near the frog, 0.1 s into the
 *   stroke, the bow paw of the red fox came up to its muzzle. With the elbow of the stage, which
 *   turns up toward the tip, the elbow stuck out to the side in the middle of the bow.
 * - The cello of `dog-views.png` plays a G3 on the G string, in the middle of a long down-bow. The
 *   bow lies square across the strings, with the frog out to the right of the player. The stage
 *   slants the bow 20° (design 5.3), and the bow then went down to the right knee.
 * - The polar bear of `polar-bear-views.png` plays C3 with the left hand and C5 with the right
 *   hand.
 * - The bear of `bear-views.png` holds the baton up in the right paw and the left paw up at the
 *   other side, as in the ready gesture of a count-in from the song start (design 5.4). The pose
 *   takes the time 1 s before the first beat, in the ready pause. The sheet has a baton in each
 *   paw, but the conductor of the app holds one baton.
