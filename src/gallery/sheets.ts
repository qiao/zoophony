 * - `dog-views.png`: the line of 1.8 m is 560 px above the line of 0 m, so 311 px for each meter.
 * - `polar-bear-views.png`: the height mark of 1.8 m is 333 px, so 185 px for each meter.
 * - `bear-views.png` has no scale in meters. The bear is 572 px high from the soles to the tops
 *   of the ears, and the conductor of the stage is 1.6 m high, so the page has 360 px for each
 *   meter. The soles are on the top of the podium at row 731, and the podium of the stage is
 *   0.35 m high, so the floor is at row 857, on the floor line of the sheet.
 *
 * The turns come from the chairs of the sheets: the front view of the rabbit shows a little of
 * its right side (20°), and the side views of the fox (65°), the rabbit (70°), and the dog (80°)
 * show a part of the front. The camera is orthographic, and the sheets have a small perspective.
