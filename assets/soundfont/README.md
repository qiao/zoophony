# SoundFont

`Zoophony.sf3` is the SoundFont of the app, an SF3 file (Ogg Vorbis samples). The build splits it
into one file for each preset (design 6.2). `tools/build-soundfont.ts` makes it from three
sources:

- GeneralUser GS 2.0.3 by S. Christian Collins gives the base: every preset that the table below
  does not name, and the keys outside the range of the new samples.
- VS Chamber Orchestra 2: Community Edition (VSCO 2 CE) by Versilian Studios gives the strings,
  the winds, the brass, and the orchestra kit.
- The Versilian Community Sample Library (VCSL) by Versilian Studios gives the piano, the
  harpsichord, the harp, the timpani, the mallets, the recorder, and the ocarina.

## Presets from the sample libraries

All samples are mono, at the rate of the source (44.1 or 48 kHz). A part keeps the first round
robin of each key and the velocity layers of the "Layers" column. A layer is the source layer
that holds the given velocity.

`tools/soundfont-recipes.ts` holds these choices, the cut of each part, and the key ranges.

## Build

The build needs Node 24 and the packages of `pnpm install`. It downloads 783 source files
(1.42 GB) from GitHub into a cache folder, checks each file with `tools/soundfont-lock.json`,
and writes `assets/soundfont/Zoophony.sf3`. Two builds with the same sources write the same
bytes.

```bash
node tools/build-soundfont.ts                    # cache: <os tmpdir>/zoophony-soundfont
node tools/build-soundfont.ts --cache <folder>   # another cache folder
node tools/build-soundfont.ts --fetch-only       # only the downloads
node tools/build-soundfont.ts --update-lock      # after a change of the recipes
```

The build prints the level of each new preset against GeneralUser GS and the headroom. When the headroom changes, change
`SOUNDFONT_HEADROOM_DB` in `src/audio/soundfont-info.ts` to the same value. A test compares the
two.
