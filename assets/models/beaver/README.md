# Beaver model

This folder holds the source mesh of the beaver and its rigged copy. The app does not serve these
files. It loads the module `src/models/studio/beaver.ts`, which this chain writes:

```text
beaver.glb                     source mesh
   │  pnpm rig-mesh beaver     config tools/mesh-rigs/beaver.json
   v
beaver.rig.glb                 rigged mesh
   │  pnpm studio-body beaver
   v
src/models/studio/beaver.ts    studio body of the app
```

`docs/agents/rigging.md` gives the steps of the chain.

## Mesh facts

The values are in the units of the studio: 1 unit from the soles to the skull top, the soles at
y = 0, +z forward, and +x the left side of the animal. The mesh faces +z, with its left side at
+x. The weld is at 1e-5.

- The weld gives 1,567 vertices in one part. 18 open edges and 8 edges with more than two faces
  lie in the whisker roots on the cheeks and in one small spot of the left armpit. 325 faces have
  a corner angle below 10°.
- The box is x -0.316 to 0.313, y 0 to 1, and z -0.395 to 0.393. The beaver is 1.9028 units of
  the file high from the soles to the skull top, which is the highest point.
- The beaver stands upright on short legs, with the crotch at y 0.125 and long flat feet forward
  to z 0.286. The round belly goes forward to z 0.34.
- The short arms hang down, out, and forward. They are apart from the body below the armpit at
  y 0.50, with the paws at y 0.36 to 0.45.
- The fur is orange-brown, with a cream belly and muzzle, dark brown paws and feet, and a dark
  gray tail.
- The eyes are dark faces of the head surface at y 0.89 to 0.92 and z 0.27 to 0.29, with no
  shells. The nose is a dark pad at the front of the muzzle, and two white front teeth stand
  under it.
- The small round ears stand on the sides of the head, at y 0.89 to 0.95 and x ±0.11 to ±0.15.
- The broad flat tail goes from its root behind the buttock (y 0.135, z -0.09) back and down to
  the floor, to its tip at z -0.395. It is up to 0.124 out to each side of the middle plane.
