# Rhino model

This folder holds the T-pose source mesh of the rhino, a copy with rebuilt arms and its weights,
and the rigged copy. The app does not serve these files. It loads the module
`src/models/studio/rhino.ts`, which this chain writes:

```text
rhino-tpose.glb                          source mesh
   │  tools/blender/rhino_tpose_arms.py  rebuilt arms and painted weights
   v
rhino-tpose-arms.glb                     `source` of tools/mesh-rigs/rhino.json
  + rhino-tpose-weights.json             `paintedWeights` of the same config
   │  pnpm rig-mesh rhino
   v
rhino.rig.glb                            rigged mesh
   │  pnpm studio-body rhino
   v
src/models/studio/rhino.ts               studio body of the app
```

`docs/agents/rigging.md` gives the steps of the chain.

## rhino-tpose.glb

The mesh has no skeleton. The arms are in a T-pose: level and out to the sides.

A weld at 1e-5 gives 1,560 vertices.

The script replaces the faces of each arm from 0.4 of the upper arm to 0.3 of the paw with a quad
tube. It wraps the tube onto the source arm and bridges it to the trunk and to the paw, with the
steps of `bear_arms.py`. The arm faces take the fur color of the source arm, from a bake into a
strip of the atlas. The faces of the paws, the trunk, the legs, and the head are the faces of the
source. A run gives the same bytes:

```bash
blender -b --factory-startup -P tools/blender/rhino_tpose_arms.py
shasum -a 256 assets/models/rhino/*.glb assets/models/rhino/rhino-tpose-weights.json
```
