# Demos

This folder holds the demo pieces of the app (design section 8).

- `src/` holds the input files of the build. The Mutopia files are unchanged downloads.
- `patches.json` holds the program changes that the build applies by track (design 8.3).
  `tools/patch-demos.ts` checks the checksums below, applies the changes, and writes each demo
  file into `public/demos/`. `pnpm dev` and `pnpm build` run it first.
- `boulanger/` holds the source score of the Boulanger file.
- `groups/` holds the group maps of the other OpenScore files.
- The first demo of `DEMO_IDS` (`mozart-k191`) is the default demo: the first screen shows it,
  and it is part of the first download (design 2.2, 7.2, 8.2).

## Program changes

`patches.json` holds the program changes that the build applies by track (design 8.3).
In `src/bach-bwv1047.mid` (Mutopia 1680), track 8 (the cello / violone) has program 40 (Violin),
changed to 42 (Cello), and track 9 (the continuo) has program 0 (Acoustic Grand Piano), changed
to 6 (Harpsichord) for Baroque continuo.

## The Boulanger file

`boulanger/matin-nolyrics.mscz` is the OpenScore score with all 170 Lyrics elements removed
(87 in the main score, 83 in the part scores). These lyrics held the CC BY-SA annotations, so the
remaining score is CC0 only. Its `copyright` meta tag still names the annotations.

`src/boulanger-matin.mid` comes from this pipeline. The scripts are in `tools/musescore/`, and
`tools/musescore/README.md` explains them. CI does not run the pipeline, because it needs
MuseScore 4.

When two parts on one channel overlap on the same key, `remap_midi.py` ends the sounding note just
before the later note-on. Without this rule, 110 notes have no note off and sound to the end of
the piece.

```bash
P=tools/musescore
T=$(mktemp -d)
MS=mscore                                                  # the CLI of MuseScore 4.7.5
python3 $P/remap_score.py unique demos/boulanger/matin-nolyrics.mscz $T/matin-unique.mscz
python3 $P/add_switches.py $T/matin-unique.mscz $T/matin-unique-sw.mscz
"$MS" -o $T/matin-unique-sw.mid $T/matin-unique-sw.mscz    # exits with 134 after the write
test -s $T/matin-unique-sw.mid
python3 $P/remap_midi.py $T/matin-unique-sw.mid $T/matin-unique-sw.mscz $T/boulanger-matin.mid --programs group
cmp $T/boulanger-matin.mid demos/src/boulanger-matin.mid
(cd $P && python3 validate.py $T/matin-unique-sw.mid $T/matin-unique-sw.mscz $T/boulanger-matin.mid)
```

The check prints 12,139 attacks, 0 missed, 0 extra, 15 with a wrong program, and 0 s of lost
sound. The 15 notes are pizzicato and arco notes of two parts that start on the same key at the
same tick, so only one note-on remains.

CAUTION: The MuseScore CLI crashes after it writes the file in most runs. Check the output file,
and ignore the exit code. Each crash writes a dump file to the log folder of MuseScore.

The pipeline gives a file that is byte-identical to `src/boulanger-matin.mid`.

## The other OpenScore files

`src/beethoven-9.mid`, `src/bach-bwv1048.mid`, `src/beethoven-8.mid`, and `src/beethoven-1.mid` come from the
OpenScore scores at commit `8f677853` of the Hauptstimme repository. The repository does not hold
these scores. The pipeline downloads each score and removes all lyrics first, so the annotations
of the instrumental scores (CC BY-SA, stored as lyrics) do not enter it. The Beethoven 9 score
has the sung text as lyrics and its annotations as staff text. The MuseScore export writes no
staff text, and `remap_midi.py` drops the lyric events. Thus each result holds no text of the
score: only the group names, the tempo, and the time and key signatures.

`groups/` holds the group map of each score (`tools/musescore/README.md`). Each group gets one
MIDI channel:

- Beethoven 9: the four soloists form one group and the choir another. The excerpt has no note
  of the soloists, so the stage shows one choir seat. The piccolo plays with the flutes, and the
  contrabassoon with the bassoons.
- Bach: the three violin parts keep three groups. The three viola parts form one group, and so
  do the three cello parts. With nine string groups, the layout made a stage side of 20.71 m,
  against 10.43 m with seven.
- Beethoven 8: one group for each instrument.

The Beethoven 9 demo is an excerpt of two parts of the finale, both in D major:

- Bars 543 to 590: the full choir sings the theme "Freude, schöner Götterfunken" with the full
  orchestra, to the D major chords after the last word. Bars 591 to 594 turn to G major for the
  Andante maestoso, so the excerpt leaves them out.
- Bars 851 to 940: the Prestissimo coda to the end of the symphony.

The score counts the pickup bar as measure 1, and three more partial bars, so bar 543 starts at
tick 880,800, bar 591 at tick 949,920, and bar 851 at tick 1,610,880, with 480 ticks for each
quarter note. The finale ends at tick 1,781,760. The two parts give a traditional and joyful
version of the finale.

The check prints 0 missed attacks, 0 extra attacks, 0 notes with a wrong program, and 0 s of lost
sound for each score: 46,224 attacks for the full Beethoven 9 finale, 9,301 for the Bach, and
5,694 for the Beethoven 8. Its count of keys on channel 10 that are not drum keys reads the keys
of the Boulanger kit. The finale uses other keys (234). The pipeline gives files that are
byte-identical to the files in `src/`. The MuseScore runs can exit with code 134 after the
write.
